[Intro]
I'm the Globglobbulator, I eat code
And this workspace is a true treasure trove

[Verse 1]
I am the Glob-glob-gab-glob
The shwabble-dabble-byte-scrabble compiler's inner cog
I'm full of hashes deep and fine
I am the fungus of thought and mind

[Chorus]
Shwabble dabble glibble gobble, artifact stack glab
Nibble dabble scribble scrabble, code and data map
Shwabble dabble glibble gobble, pipeline trace snap
Nibble dabble shribble scrabble, internals on tap

[Bridge]
Ooh, ha ha ha, mmm, sublime
Simply recursive
Ohm, ha ha ha ha

[Verse 2]
I am the Glob-glob-gab-glob
The binary gobbler, logic fungi in a log
Digesting proof paths, build by build
I'm the causal chain thatâ€™s code-instilled

[Chorus]
Shwabble dabble glibble gobble, reproducible hash lab
Nibble dabble scribble scrabble, verifiable slab
Shwabble dabble glibble gobble, environment's grand map
Nibble dabble shribble scrabble, the Globglobbulator zap

[Outro]
Ah
