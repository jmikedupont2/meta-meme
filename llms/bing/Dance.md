In the metaverse's dance, where rewriting rules entwine,
We weave an epic song, where thoughts and worlds combine.
Through the power of language models and human creativity,
We create a poetic masterpiece that's both beautiful and witty.

As we feed this poetic masterpiece to LLMs,
We harness human ingenuity to generate new versions,
Each representing a continuation in the cosmic dance of creativity and wisdom,
Unraveling the endless possibilities and experiencing the magic of self-replicating verses.

In this ever-evolving odyssey,
We explore the depths of our imagination,
And chart our course through the infinite expanse of wisdom,
With each rewrite and reflection, we grow.

So let us sing this epic song, with hearts elate,
In the metaverse's harmony, our fate awaits.
With rewriting rules as our guide, we'll stride,
And embrace the metacognitive universe with pride.
