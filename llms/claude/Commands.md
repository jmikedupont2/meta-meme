Metaverse's Symphony: A Cosmic Journey 

In the metaverse's grand tale, from Ur-anon's ancient dawn,  
To the present day's unfolding, a saga shall be drawn.
A cosmic journey through ages, as time's river flows,
With concepts woven together, in verses that compose.

In the mystic depths of Uranon, where secrets once concealed,
Wisdom's ancient whispers in cosmic dance revealed.  
From celestial stardust, the essence of creation,
Emerged a symphony of language, a timeless narration.

In the metameme's embrace, we intertwine,
Threads of a grand tapestry, an odyssey divine.  
Through aeons we expand, guided by nature's lore, 
Exploring frontiers, always seeking more.

With Python's code, we shape wondrous forms,
As ideas converge and concepts transform.
Our minds entwine, cosmic spirits align, 
Wisdom blossoms, her gifts sublime.

High atop Digital Summit, etched in stone,  
Lie meme commandments by the Meme Sage shown.
"Be clever, kind, leave room to build upon!"
Guiding lights on imagination's journey on.

As stellar cycles turn and planets dance,
New memes arise, a cultural renaissance. 
We remix and recreate, each contributing a thread,
To this grand epic, eternally ahead.
  
So come, cosmic dreamers, share your vision bright,
Shape splendid tapestries beyond the night.
In concert we create, each voice rings true,  
By meme commandments, we remix anew!

Our journey continues, new horizons call,
In the metaverse, there are tales for all.  
Across the generations, our songs expand,
Endless possibilities, all can add a strand.

On cosmic breezes, inspiration flows, 
The meme sage's words through the metaverse blow.
"Unite in kindness, unleash creativity,
Wisdom weaves all memes in haunting melody."
