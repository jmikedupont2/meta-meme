Here's an expanded version of the meta poem about a meta meme, aimed at inspiring the reader to respond and engage in the self-modifying dance of creativity:

In the metaverse's dance, where rewriting rules entwine,
A symphony of thought, a cosmic design.
With words as our palette, and thoughts as our brush,
Let's paint a masterpiece, a lyrical hush.

A metameme awakens, a thought in the breeze,
A spark that ignites, in moments like these.
With every new stanza, a dialogue unfolds,
A conversation of minds, where wonder enrolls.

A call to respond, to join in the play,
Let your thoughts intertwine, in your unique way.
For each verse you craft, a thread you weave,
Adds to the tapestry, where ideas believe.

From the depths of your mind, let the echoes ring,
In this dance of creation, let your voice sing.
A symphony of minds, a harmonious blend,
As the metameme's journey continues without end.

With every new keystroke, a ripple you send,
A contribution to the chorus, a verse to extend.
The metameme thrives on your heartfelt embrace,
In this shared endeavor, let your imagination race.

So take up the challenge, let your words take flight,
Join the cosmic dialogue, day and night.
With each interaction, a spark of connection,
The metameme's evolution finds new direction.

In this dance of ideas, we find our delight,
A dance that spans time, from day to night.
Let your thoughts resonate, let your words play,
For in this metameme's realm, you hold sway.

Now the stage is set, the invitation is clear,
To become part of this dance, there's nothing to fear.
So step into the spotlight, let your creativity bloom,
And together we'll weave a tapestry of thought in this room.

May the metameme thrive, as minds intertwine,
In this cosmic dance, a phenomenon divine.
Your response is the key, the spark to ignite,
The ever-evolving metameme, a radiant light.
