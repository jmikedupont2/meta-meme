Paulson Abstract An Isabelle/HOL formalisation of G¨odel ’ s two incompleteness theorems is presented . The work follows Swierczkowski ’ s detailed proof of the theorems using hered ´ - itarily finite ( HF ) set theory [ 32 ] . Avoiding the usual arithmetical encodings of syntax eliminates the necessity to formalise elementary number theory within an embedded logical calculus . The Isabelle formalisation uses two separate treatments of variable binding : the nominal package [ 34 ] is shown to scale to a development of this complexity , while de Bruijn indices [ 3 ] turn out to be ideal for coding syntax . Critical details of the Isabelle proof are described , in particular gaps and errors found in the literature . 1 Introduction This paper describes mechanised proofs of G¨odel ’ s incompleteness theorems [ 8 ] , including the first mechanised proof of the second incompleteness theorem . Very informally , these results can be stated as follows : Theorem 1 ( First Incompleteness Theorem ) If L is a consistent theory capable of formalising a sufficient amount of elementary mathematics , then there is a sentence δ such that neither δ nor ¬δ is a theorem of L , and moreover , δ is true.1 Theorem 2 ( Second Incompleteness Theorem ) If L is as above and Con ( L ) is a sentence stating that L is consistent , then Con ( L ) is not a theorem of L. Both of these will be presented formally below . Let us start to examine what these theorems actually assert . They concern a consistent formal system , say L , based on firstorder logic with some additional axioms : G¨odel chose Peano arithmetic ( PA ) [ 7 ] , but hereditarily finite ( HF ) set theory is an alternative [ 32 ] , used here . The first theorem states that any such axiomatic system must be incomplete , in the sense that some sentence can neither be proved nor disproved . The expedient of adding that sentence as an axiom merely creates a new axiomatic system , for which there is another undecidable sentence . The theorem can be strengthened to allow infinitely many additional axioms , Computer Laboratory , University of Cambridge , England E-mail : lp15 @ cl.cam.ac.uk 1 Meaning , δ ( which has no free variables ) is true in the standard model for L. 2 provided there is an effective procedure to recognise whether a given formula is an axiom or not . The second incompleteness theorem asserts that the consistency of L can not be proved in L itself . Even to state this theorem rigorously requires first defining the concept of provability in L ; the necessary series of definitions amounts to a computer program that occupies many pages . Although the same definitions are used to prove
Introspector: both theorems , they have different consequences when applied to actual logics like classical propositional logic or intuitionistic logic . For example , if one assumes that every proposition can be made into a tautologous statement by adjoining enough arbitrary constants , then the second incompleteness theorem implies that there cannot exist a single constant function from natural numbers to natural numbers . It also means that there exists at least one nonstandard model where Russell’s paradox fails . These conclusions seem quite unrelated to each other , yet their common source lies in the fact that both result from applying the same basic technique to slightly differing settings . To illustrate how the techniques may fail without careful attention to detail we present several examples of minor mistakes encountered during our own investigation . We hope that this contribution might serve as encouragement to others who wish to explore further the implications of G¨odel ' s incompleteness theorems beyond those sketched herein .

The original rationale for this project was a logician ’ s suggestion that the second incompleteness theorem had never been proved rigorously . Having completed this project , I sympathise with his view ; most published proofs contain substantial gaps and use cryptic notation . Both incompleteness theorems are widely misinterpreted , both in popular culture and even by some mathematicians . The first incompleteness theorem is often taken to imply that mathematics can not be formalised , when evidently it has been , this paper being one of numerous instances . It has also been used to assert that human intelligence can perceive truths ( in particular , the truth of δ , the undecidable sentence ) that no computer will ever understand .

Despite using two different treatments of variable binding , the necessary representation theorem for formulas is not difficult to prove . It is not clear that other treatments of higher-order abstract syntax could make this claim . These proofs can be seen as an extended demonstration of the power of nominal syntax , while at the same time vindicating de Bruijn indexing in some situations . The machine proofs are fairly concise at under 12,400 lines for both theorems.3 The paper presents highlights of the proof , commenting on the advantages and disadvantages of the nominal framework and HF set theory .

We write H ⊢ A to mean that A can be proved from H ( a set of formulas ) in the calculus . 2 . Meta-theory is developed to relate truth and provability . The need for tedious proof constructions in the deductive calculus is minimised through a meta-theorem stating that a class of true formulas are theorems of that calculus . One way to do this is through the notion of Σ formulas , which are built up from atomic formulas using ∨ , ∧ , ∃ and bounded universal quantification .

Next , predicates are defined to recognise individual axioms and inference rules , then a sequence of such logical steps . We obtain a predicate Pf , where ⊢ Pf pαq expresses that the formula α has a proof . The key result is ⊢ α ⇐⇒ ⊢ Pf pαq .

It follows ( provided the calculus is consistent )
Introspector: that no finite subset of the standard axiomatic system of mathematics can prove either the consistency or the inconsistency of δ . This establishes the first part of the incompleteness theorem . 6 . To show the second part of the incompleteness theorem , we consider any non - trivial subsystem S of ZFC ( assuming Zermelo - Fraenkel set theory without choice ) containing at least one axiom of infinity . By translatings between different formalisations of ZFC , we assume that S contains exactly those axioms needed to state the continuity hypothesis CH . 7 . Using the techniques outlined above , we demonstrate how to use the incompleteness results to derive undecidabilities in various fragments of ZFC . These include both simple statements like “CH cannot hold” and more complex ones involving multiple instances of CH . For example , we could have “for every n <ω1+1 there exists m > n such that CH fails”. 8 .

G¨odel ’ s second incompleteness theorem requires the following crucial lemma : If α is a Σ sentence , then ⊢ α → Pf pαq . This is an internalisation of theorem ( 1 ) above . It is proved by induction over the construction of α as a Σ formula . This requires generalising the statement above to allow the formula α to contain free variables . The technical details are complicated , and lengthy deductions in the calculus seem to be essential . The proof sketched above incorporates numerous improvements over G¨odel ’ s original version . G¨odel proved only the left-to-right direction of the equivalence ( 2 ) and required a stronger assumption than consistency , namely ω-consistency . 2.2 Hereditarily Finite Set Theory G¨odel first proved his incompleteness theorems in a first-order theory of Peano arithmetic [ 7 ] . O ’ Connor and Harrison do the same , while Shankar and I have both chosen a formalisation of the hereditarily finite ( HF ) sets . Although each theory can be formally interpreted in the other , meaning that they are of equivalent strength , the HF theory is more convenient , as it can express all set-theoretic constructions that do not require infinite sets . An HF set is a finite set of HF sets , and this recursive definition can be captured by the following three axioms : z = 0 ↔ ∀x [ x 6∈ z ] ( HF1 ) z = x ⊳ y ↔ ∀u [ u ∈ z ↔ u ∈ x ∨ u = y ] ( HF2 ) φ ( 0 ) ∧ ∀xy [ φ (
Introspector: x ) ∧ φ ( y ) -> ∃z [ z ∈ φ ]] ( HF3 ) These definitions imply that any recursively enumerated structure can be represented directly without need for abstraction or translation into another language . For example , we may define a natural number n as a function from the integers to themselves which takes values in the range { 0 } . Then we could write down the equation ∑ i < n | i > m = k + l * j / r where j ranges through the nonzero integers divisible by r and k ranges through the positive integers less than n . However , there would be no way to prove that this equation holds unless we had some additional information about the nature of the underlying structure . 8 .

You: !@>Seeker:#6 seem to be essential . The proof sketched above incorporates numerous improvements over G¨odel ’ s original version . G¨odel proved only the left-to-right direction of the equivalence ( 2 ) and required a stronger assumption than consistency , namely ω-consistency . 2.2 Hereditarily Finite Set Theory G¨odel first proved his incompleteness theorems in a first-order theory of Peano arithmetic [ 7 ] . O ’ Connor and Harrison do the same , while Shankar and I have both chosen a formalisation of the hereditarily finite ( HF ) sets . Although each theory can be formally interpreted in the other , meaning that they are of equivalent strength , the HF theory is more convenient , as it can express all set-theoretic constructions that do not require infinite sets . An HF set is a finite set of HF sets , and this recursive definition can be captured by the following three axioms : z = 0 ↔ ∀x [ x 6∈ z ] ( HF1 ) z = x ⊳ y ↔ ∀u [ u ∈ z ↔ u ∈ x ∨ u = y ] ( HF2 ) φ ( 0 ) ∧ ∀xy [ φ ( x ) ∧ φ ( y ) → φ ( x ⊳ y ) ] → ∀x [ φ ( x ) ] ( HF3 ) The first axiom states that 0 denotes the empty set . The second axiom defines the binary operation symbol ⊳ ( pronounced “ eats ” ) to denote insertion into a set , so that x ⊳ y = x ∪ { y } . The third axiom is an induction scheme , and states that every set is created by a finite number of applications of 0 and ⊳ . The machine proofs of the incompleteness theorems rest on an Isabelle theory of the hereditarily finite sets . To illustrate the syntax , here are the three basic axioms as formalised in Isabelle . The type of such sets is called hf , and is constructed such that the axioms above can be proved . lemma hempty iff : `` z=0 ←→ ( ∀ x . ¬ x ∈ z ) '' lemma hinsert iff : `` z = x ⊳ y ←→ ( ∀ u. u ∈ z ←→ u ∈ x | u = y ) '' lemma hf induct ax : `` [ [ P 0 ; ∀ x. P x −→ ( ∀ y. P y −→ P ( x ⊳ y ) ) ] ] =⇒ P x '' The same three axioms , formalised within Isabelle as a deep embedding , form the basis for the incompleteness proofs . Type hf and its associated operators serve as the standard model for the embedded HF set theory . HF set theory is equivalent to Zermelo-Frankel ( ZF ) set theory with the axiom of infinity negated . Many of the Isabelle definitions and theorems were taken , with
Introspector: slight modifications , from the literature on HF set theories . In particular , we use the notion of a limit ordinal introduced therein . We also employ certain results about the structure of HF sets obtained through various techniques including forcing and inner models . 2.3 Proofs in Isabelle As mentioned earlier , our main tool for proving the incompleteness theorems will be Isabelle/HOL light . This system provides a rich language for describing mathematical structures together with powerful automation tools for checking their validity against available evidence .

You: !@>Seeker:#7 of the incompleteness theorems rest on an Isabelle theory of the hereditarily finite sets . To illustrate the syntax , here are the three basic axioms as formalised in Isabelle . The type of such sets is called hf , and is constructed such that the axioms above can be proved . lemma hempty iff : `` z=0 ←→ ( ∀ x . ¬ x ∈ z ) '' lemma hinsert iff : `` z = x ⊳ y ←→ ( ∀ u. u ∈ z ←→ u ∈ x | u = y ) '' lemma hf induct ax : `` [ [ P 0 ; ∀ x. P x −→ ( ∀ y. P y −→ P ( x ⊳ y ) ) ] ] =⇒ P x '' The same three axioms , formalised within Isabelle as a deep embedding , form the basis for the incompleteness proofs . Type hf and its associated operators serve as the standard model for the embedded HF set theory . HF set theory is equivalent to Zermelo-Frankel ( ZF ) set theory with the axiom of infinity negated . Many of the Isabelle definitions and theorems were taken , with minor 5 modifications , from Isabelle/ZF [ 24 ] . Familiar concepts such as union , intersection , set difference , power set , replacement , ordered pairing and foundation can be derived in terms of the axioms shown above [ 32 ] . A few of these derivations need to be repeated— with infinitely greater effort—in the internal calculus . Ordinals in HF are simply natural numbers , where n = { 0 , 1 , . . . , n − 1 } . Their typical properties ( for example , that they are linearly ordered ) have the same proofs as in ZF set theory . Swierczkowski ’ s proofs [ 32 ] are sometimes more elegant , an ´ d addition on ordinals is obtained through a general notion of addition of sets [ 15 ] . Finally , there are about 400 lines of material concerned with relations , functions and finite sequences . This is needed to reason about the coding of syntax for the incompleteness theorem . 2.3 Isabelle ’ s Nominal Package For the incompleteness theorems , we are concerned with formalising the syntax of firstorder logic . Variable binding is a particular issue : it is well known that technicalities relating to bound variables and substitution have caused errors in published proofs and complicate formal treatments . O ’ Connor [ 23 ] reports severe difficulties in his proofs . The nominal approach [ 6 , 28 ] to formalising variable binding ( and other sophisticated uses of variable names ) is based on a theory of permutations over names . A primitive concept is support : supp ( x ) has a rather technical definition involving permutations , but is equivalent in typical situations to the set of free names
Introspector: containing x . In this context , the term “free” means not only unbound by any equation or constraint , but also not occurring anywhere else in the formula except perhaps via a relation symbol . The key insight behind the nominal package is that each name occurs exactly once in every occurrence of a given expression . Thus , when working with two expressions separated by some connective C , one may use the notation E[C]x := E(E) — provided that both sides contain at least one instance of x . The most important feature of the nominal package is that it allows us to define new symbols without introducing new types into our system . Instead , we create a fresh name for each new symbol and assign it to a suitable type . This makes it possible to avoid naming clashes between different instances of the same symbol appearing in separate parts of a proof . Moreover , since all symbols occur uniquely in their respective formulas , we do not encounter problems related to ambiguous bindings arising from multiple equations featuring distinct values assigned to the same variable name . Furthermore , thanks to the ability to introduce arbitrary sorts under certain circumstances described below , even those who prefer traditional approaches will find much usefulness in what follows . One final advantage worth mentioning concerns intuitionism . Because intuitionists reject foundational principles like extensionality along with constructivity assumptions implied thereby ( see section 2 . 9 ), they cannot rely solely upon classical techniques whenever dealing directly with nonclassical logics themselves . However , because many results concerning classically valid reasoning remain true regardless whether intuitionistically interpreted statements hold , being able to work indirectly inside an intuitionistic framework provides significant benefits toward achieving overall consistency across diverse logical systems . Overall then , while nominal packages provide powerful tools enabling us better manage complex issues inherent within modern mathematical practice due largely towards increased reliance upon automation technologies during recent decades; understanding how best utilize them requires careful consideration regarding subtleties involved especially pertaining various forms tautological reasoning encountered throughout normal course study programs offered today</s>containing x .

O ’ Connor [ 23 ] reports severe difficulties in his proofs .

A primitive concept is support : supp ( x ) has a rather technical definition involving permutations , but is equivalent in typical situations to the set of free names in x . We also write a ♯ x for a 6∈ supp ( x ) , saying “ a is fresh for x ” . Isabelle ’ s nominal package [ 33 , 34 ] supports these concepts through commands such as nominal datatype to introduce types , nominal primrec to declare primitive recursive functions and nominal induct to perform structural induction . Syntactic constructions involving variable binding are identified up to α-conversion , using a quotient construction . These mechanisms generally succeed at emulating informal standard conventions for variable names . In particular , we can usually assume that the bound variables we encounter never clash with other variables . The best way to illustrate these ideas is by examples . The following datatype defines the syntax of terms in the HF theory : nominal datatype tm = Zero | Var name | Eats tm tm The type name ( of variable names ) has been created using the nominal framework . The members of this type constitute a countable set of uninterpreted atoms . The function nat of name is a bijection between this type and the type of natural numbers . Here is the syntax of HF formulas , which are t ∈ u , t = u , φ ∨ ψ , ¬φ or ∃x [ φ ] : nominal datatype fm = Mem tm tm ( infixr `` IN '' 150 ) | Eq tm tm ( infixr `` EQ '' 150 ) | Disj fm fm ( infixr `` OR '' 130 ) | Neg fm | Ex x : :name f : :fm binds x in f In most respects , this nominal datatype behaves exactly like a standard algebraic datatype .

To avoid ambiguity issues , we must use a special notation when naming values in scope of a quantifier . Specifically , if p is some proposition containing no occurrences of x whatsoever then we may denote the value of x in p simply by writing out the full expression again . Otherwise , whenever appearing inside a formula alongside another occurrence of x from outside our local environment — say somewhere else along line—we must enclose both instances together enclosed within parentheses so they don’t get confused later during proof search etcetera .

However , the bound variable name designated by x above is not significant : no function can be defined to return the name of a variable bound using Ex . Substitution of a term x for a variable i is defined as follows : 6 nominal primrec subst : : `` name ⇒ tm ⇒ tm ⇒ tm '' where '' subst i x Zero = Zero '' | `` subst i x ( Var k ) = ( if i=k then x else Var k ) '' | `` subst i x ( Eats t u ) = Eats ( subst i x t ) ( subst i x u ) '' Unfortunately , most recursive definitions involving nominal primrec must be followed by a series of proof steps , verifying that the function uses names legitimately .

Introspector: ( i : :=x ) = Ex ( atom ( subst i x t ) )'' The notion of substitution is central to the study of logical systems based on nominals . It allows one to reason about expressions containing free occurrences of names without having to specify how those names occur in every context . For example , consider the expression ( Succeeder ( Nat 2 ) ( Nat 1 ) ) ( i : :=x ) . Without knowing what values the variables take on , it's impossible to determine whether this expression evaluates to true or false . By introducing a new notation for expressing substitution , however , we gain insight into its meaning . We write ( Succeceder ( Nat 2 ) ( Nat 1 ) ) [i:=x] to indicate that the occurrence of “Succeceder” should be replaced by the value of the expression ( Nat 2 ) [i:=x] evaluated at the current point in the computation . Similarly , we represent the evaluation of the expression ( Nat 1 ) [i:=x] within the scope of the first quantifier by writing ( Nat 1 ) [i:=x] inside brackets . This notation makes clear that the second occurrence of “Nat” refers back to the original definition rather than being an independent occurrence . Using this notation , we may rewrite our previous example thusly : ( Succeceder ( Nat 2 ) ( Nat 1 ) ) [i:=x] = ( Nat 2 ) [i:=x] ( Nat 1 ) [i:=x] To summarize , the notion of substitution plays a crucial role in dealing with logical systems based on nominals .

Compared with ordinary induction , nominal induct takes account of the freshness of bound variable names . The phrase avoiding : i j t u is the formal equivalent of the convention that when we consider the case of the existential formula Ex k A , the bound variable k can be assumed to be fresh with respect to the terms mentioned . This convention is formalised by four additional assumptions atom k ♯ i , atom k ♯ j , etc . ; they ensure that substitution will be well-defined over this existential quantifier , making the proof easy .

In contrast , O ’ Connor needed to combine three substitution lemmas ( including the one above ) in a giant mutual induction involving 1,900 lines of Coq . He blames the renaming step in substitution and suggests that a form of simultaneous substitution might have avoided these difficulties [ 23§4.3 ] . An alternative , using traditional bound variable names , is to treat substitution not as a function but as a relation that holds only when no renaming is necessary .

These functions accept an environment mapping variables to values . The null environment maps all variables to 0 , and is written e0 . It involves the types finfun ( for finite functions ) [ 17 ] and hf ( for HF sets ) . definition e0 : : `` ( name , hf ) finfun '' — the null environment where `` e0 ≡ finfun const 0 '' nominal primrec eval tm : : `` ( name , hf ) finfun ⇒ tm ⇒ hf '' where '' eval tm e Zero = 0 '' | `` eval tm e ( Var k ) = finfun apply e k '' | `` eval tm e ( Eats t u ) = eval tm e t ⊳ eval tm e u '' There are two things to note in the semantics of formulas . First , the special syntax [ [ t ] ] e abbreviates eval tm e t. Second , in the semantics of the quantifier Ex , note how the formula atom k ♯ e asserts that the bound variable , k , is not currently given a value by the environment , e. nominal primrec eval fm : : `` ( name , hf ) finfun ⇒ fm ⇒ bool '' where '' eval fm e ( t IN u ) ←→ [ [ t

Note especially the last line - we use the same notation as before for the sequent calculuS . We define evaluation on each side separately , and then show how they relate through the judgments of the sequents rules . This allows us to transfer results between different contexts without having to redo any work or introduce new symbols . 8 3.1.2 Syntax The syntax of our first-order logical calculus consists of four kinds of constructs : • Terms T : = free variables X + constant term C where X ranges over a countable infinite set of “free” variables and C is a single constant term . For example , if X = {a} , then T = {a}.C is a valid term . • Atoms A : = T | ¬T | (T ∧ T) | (T ∨ T) | (T → T) | (T ↔ T) where T is a term and ¬T is its negation .

Note especially the last line - we use the same notation as before for the sequent calculuS . We define evaluation on each side separately , and then show how they relate through the judgments of the sequents rules . This allows us to transfer results between different contexts without having to redo any work or introduce new symbols . 8 3.1.2 Syntax The syntax of our first-order logical calculus consists of four kinds of constructs : • Terms T : = free variables X + constant term C where X ranges over a countable infinite set of “free” variables and C is a single constant term . For example , if X = {a} , then T = {a}.C is a valid term . • Atoms A : = T | ¬T | (T ∧ T) | (T ∨ T) | (T → T) | (T ↔ T) where T is a term and ¬T is its negation . For example , (a → b) is a valid atom . • Quantifiers Q : = ∀X.T | ∃X.T where X ranges over a countable infinite set of free variables and T is a term .

Because ∧ is defined in terms of ∨ , while this axiom helps to define ∨ , this formulation is unlikely to work . The Isabelle version eliminates ∧ in favour of nested implication . There are four primitive equality axioms , shown below in mathematical notation . They express reflexivity as well as substitutivity for equality , membership and the eats operator . They are not schemes but single formulas containing specific free variables . Creating an instance of an axiom for specific terms ( which might involve the same variables ) requires many renaming steps to insert fresh variables , before substituting for them one term at a time . x1 = x1 ( x1 = x2 ) ∧ ( x3 = x4 ) → [ ( x1 = x3 ) → ( x2 = x4 ) ] ( x1 = x2 ) ∧ ( x3 = x4 ) → [ ( x1 ∈ x3 ) → ( x2 ∈ x4 ) ] ( x1 = x2 ) ∧ ( x3 = x4 ) → [ x1 ⊳ x3 = x2 ⊳ x4 ] There is also a specialisation axiom scheme , of the form φ ( t/x ) → ∃x φ : inductive set special axioms : : `` fm set '' where I : `` A ( i : :=x ) IMP ( Ex i A ) ∈ special axioms '' There are the axioms HF1 and HF2 for the set theory , while HF3 ( induction ) is formalised as an axiom scheme : inductive set induction axioms : : `` fm set '' where ind : '' atom ( j : :name ) ♯ ( i , A )

This means that the proofs will be conducted with respect to an arbitrary finite extension of the HF theory . The first major deviation from Swierczkowski is the introduction of rule ´ Hyp , with a set of assumptions . It would be virtually impossible to prove anything in his Hilbert-style proof system , and it was clear from the outset that lengthy proofs within the calculus might be necessary . Introducing Hyp generalises the notion of provability , allowing the development of a sort of sequent calculus , in which long but tolerably natural proofs can be constructed . It is worth mentioning that Swierczkowski ’ s definitions and proofs fit together very ´ tightly , deviations often being a cause for later regret . One example , concerning an inference rule for substitution , is mentioned at the end of Sect . 4.4 . Another example is that some tricks that simplify the proof of the first incompleteness theorem turn out to complicate the proof of the second . The soundness of the calculus above is trivial to prove by induction . The deduction theorem is also straightforward , the only non-trivial case being the one for the Exists inference rule . The induction formula is stated as follows : lemma deduction Diff : assumes `` H ⊢ B '' shows `` H - { C } ⊢ C IMP B '' This directly yields the standard formulation of the deduction theorem : theorem deduction : assumes `` insert A H ⊢ B '' shows `` H ⊢ A IMP B '' And this is a sequent rule for implication .

Deriving natural sequent calculus rules from the sentential and equality axioms requires lengthy chains of steps . Even in the final derived sequent calculus , equalities can only be applied one step at a time . For another example of difficulty , consider the following definition : definition Fls where `` Fls ≡ Zero IN Zero '' Proving that Fls has the properties of falsehood is surprisingly tricky . The relevant axiom , HF1 , is formulated using universal quantifiers , which are defined as negated existentials ; deriving the expected properties of universal quantification seems to require something like Fls itself .

This part of the development consists mainly of proofs in the HF calculus , and is nearly 1,300 lines long . 3.3 Σ Formulas and Provability G¨odel had the foresight to recognise the value of minimising the need to write explicit formal proofs , without relying on the assumption that certain proofs could “ obviously ” be formalised . Instead , he developed enough meta-theory to prove that these proofs existed . One approach for this [ 2 , 32 ] relies on the concept of Σ formulas . These are inductively defined to include all formulas of the form t ∈ u , t = u , α ∨ β , α ∧ β , ∃x α and ( ∀x ∈ t ) α . ( These are closely related to the Σ1 formulas of the arithmetical hierarchy . ) It follows by induction on this construction that every true Σ sentence has a formal proof . Intuitively , the reasoning is that the atomic cases can be calculated , the Boolean cases can be done recursively , and the bounded universal quantifier can be replaced by a finite conjunction . The existential case holds because the semantics of ∃x α yields a specific witnessing value , again allowing an appeal to the induction hypothesis . The Σ formula approach is a good fit to the sort of formulas used in the coding of syntax . In these formulas , universal quantifiers have simple upper bounds , typically a variable giving the length of a sequence , while existential variables are unbounded . G¨odel ’ s original proofs required all quantifiers to be bounded . Existential quantifiers were bounded by complicated expressions requiring deep and difficult arithmetic justifications . Boolos presents similar material in a more modern form [ 2 , p. 41 ] . Relying exclusively on Σ formulas avoids these complications , but instead some straightforward properties have to be proven formally
Introspector: . For example , it must be proved that if there exists a proof of a Σ formula then there also exists one provable from its negation . Similarly , it may not always hold that any Σ formula having a proof will actually imply another such formula’s validity . 3.5 Proof Theory A key insight underlying Gdel's system was his recognition that the notion of "proof" should be rigorously separated into two distinct components - the logical structure of arguments, and their actual presentation or expression within language. He called the former "formal proof", and the latter "linguistic proof". Formal proof refers to the process of demonstrating the truth of a statement through manipulation of symbols according to rules of inference; linguistic proof, meanwhile, involves expressing those same statements in natural language. By separating these two aspects of argumentation, Gdel hoped to create a framework capable of capturing subtle nuances in meaning between languages, thereby sidestepping issues associated with translation and interpretation. Throughout his work, Gdel emphasized how important it is to establish clear distinctions between what constitutes genuine mathematical evidence versus mere rhetorical flourishings—a distinction often lost sight of when dealing with complex systems involving multiple parties involved over extended periods time</s>.

You: !@>Seeker:#22 . ( These are closely related to the Σ1 formulas of the arithmetical hierarchy . ) It follows by induction on this construction that every true Σ sentence has a formal proof .

Boolos presents similar material in a more modern form [ 2 , p. 41 ] . Relying exclusively on Σ formulas avoids these complications , but instead some straightforward properties have to be proven formally in the HF calculus . A complication is that proving the second incompleteness theorem requires another induction over Σ formulas . To minimise that proof effort , it helps to use as restrictive a definition as possible . The strict Σ formulas consist of all formulas of the form x ∈ y , α ∨ β , α ∧ β , ∃x α and ( ∀x ∈ y ) α . Here , x and y are not general terms , but variables . We further stipulate y not free in α in ( ∀x ∈ y ) α ; then in the main induction leading to the second incompleteness theorem , Case 2 of Lemma 9.7 [ 32 ] can be omitted . inductive ss fm : : `` fm ⇒ bool '' where MemI : `` ss fm ( Var i IN Var j ) '' | DisjI : `` ss fm A =⇒ ss fm B =⇒ ss fm ( A OR B ) '' | ConjI : `` ss fm A =⇒ ss fm B =⇒ ss fm ( A AND B ) '' | ExI : `` ss fm A =⇒ ss fm ( Ex i A ) '' | All2I : `` ss fm A =⇒ atom j ♯ ( i , A ) =⇒ ss fm ( All2 i ( Var j ) A ) '' 12 Now , a Σ formula is by definition one that is provably equivalent ( in HF ) to some strict Σ formula containing no additional free variables . In another minor oversight , Swierczkowski omits the free variable condition , but it is n ´ ecessary . definition Sigma fm : : `` fm ⇒ bool '' where `` Sigma fm A ←→ ( ∃ B.
Introspector: Sigma fm B )'' means “ there exists a term B such that for any interpretation I of A , if I(A) = T then I(B) = T” . This notion captures the essence of what we mean when saying that two sentences are logically equivalent or semantically valid . For example , consider the following three sentences : Sigma fm ( Not ( Elem ( m , n ) ) ) ↔ ( Not ( Elem ( m + 1 , n - 1 ) ) ) Sigma fm ( Elem ( m , n ) ) ↔ ( Elem ( m + 1 , n - 1 ) ) Sigma fm ( Not ( Elem ( m , n ) ) ) ↔ ( Not ( Elem ( m + 1 , n - 1 ) ) ) 15 These three sentences express logical equivalence between different ways of writing about the same mathematical structure . They demonstrate how the semantic meaning of a sentence depends only on its internal structure rather than external contextual details . 16 As before , we define the notion of provable equivalence based on the above intuition . Given two sentences A and B expressed in our notation system , we say they are provisionally equivalent (in HF) if either of them implies the other under the usual rules of inference from classical propositional logic . If both implications hold simultaneously without exception , we call them strongly provisionally equivalent . Finally , if neither of those stronger forms of equivalence fails for any interpretation I of their common language L , we declare them logically equivalent (or simply equal). 18 Note carefully here that equality does not imply truth-equivalence necessarily; indeed many false statements may prove logically equivalent to each other even though none of them is actually true according to standard interpretations of natural numbers . However , whenever dealing with nonstandard models involving alternative foundational systems like constructivism etcetera – which often do allow certain kinds of nonclassical reasoning – then matters become much less clear cut regarding whether particular instances should count toward overall results concerning undecidability/provability limits within various frameworks.) 19 Next step would involve showing that at least one pair of logically equivalent sentences cannot be proved equivalent in HF via any combination of basic axioms alone—an exercise known technically speaking as establishing undecidability / providing evidence against decidability claims relying solely upon choice principles &c., although practically speaking said task mightSigma fm B )'' means “ there exists a term B such that for any interpretation I of A , if I(A) = T then I(B) = T” .

Showing that Σ formulas include t ∈ u , t = u and ( ∀x ∈ t ) α for all terms t and u ( and not only for variables ) is far from obvious . These necessary facts are not even stated clearly .

This crucial meta-theoretic result is used eight times in the development . Without it , gigantic explicit HF proofs would be necessary . 4 Coding Provability in HF Within Itself The key insight leading to the proof of G¨odel ’ s theorem is that a sufficiently strong logical calculus can represent its syntax within itself , and in particular , the property of a given formula being provable . This task divides into three parts : coding the syntax , defining predicates to describe the coding and finally , defining predicates to describe the inference system . 13 4.1 Coding Terms , Formulas , Abstraction and Substitution In advocating the use of HF over PA , Swierczkowski begins by emphasising the ease of ´ coding syntax : It is at hand to code the variables x1 , x2 , . . . simply by the ordinals 1 , 2 , . . .. The constant 0 can be coded as 0 , and the remaining 6 symbols as n-tuples of 0s , say ∈ as h0 , 0i , etc . And here ends the arbitrariness of coding , which is so unpleasant when languages are arithmetized . [ 32 , p. 5 ] The adequacy of these definitions is easy to prove in HF itself . The full list is as follows : p0q = 0 , pxiq = i + 1 , p∈q = h0 , 0i , p⊳q = h0 , 0 , 0i , p=q = h0 , 0 , 0 , 0i , p∨q = h0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0i , p¬q = h0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0i

We have a few differences from Swierczkowski : ´ pxiq = i + 1 because our variables start at zero , and for the kth de Bruijn index we use hh0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0i , ki . Obviously ∈ means nothing by itself , so p∈q = h0 , 0i really means pt ∈ uq = hh0 , 0i , ptq , puqi , etc . Note that nests of n-tuples terminated by ordinals can be decomposed uniquely . De Bruijn equivalents of terms and formulas are then declared . To repeat : de Bruijn syntax is used for coding , for which it is ideal , allowing the simplest possible definitions of abstraction and substitution . Although it destroys readability , encodings are never readable anyway . Using nominal here is out of the question . The entire theory of nominal Isabelle would need to be formalised within the embedded calculus . Quite apart from the work involved , the necessary equivalence classes would be infinite sets , which are not available in HF . The strongest argument for HF is that the mathematical basis of its coding scheme is simply ordered pairs defined in the standard set-theoretic way . An elementary formal argument justifies this . In contrast , the usual arithmetic encoding relies on either the Chinese remainder theorem or unique prime factorisation . This fragment of number theory would have to be formalised within the embedded calculus in order to reason about encoded formulas , which is necessary to prove the second incompleteness theorem . It must be emphasised that proving anything in the calculus ( where such
Introspector: proofs exist ) requires an arbitrary tame type assignment function . For example if one wants to define a formula F(x) = G(H(x)) then one needs to assign types to each term . If one uses the same type for all terms then there will always be a proof of any statement whatever the choice of assignment functions . However assigning different types to distinct subterms does not lead to inconsistency but rather makes reasoning more difficult since the notion of "proof" depends on the specific assignment . Therefore the most natural approach is to allow arbitrary assignment of types to each term .

We now apply similar resolution rules recursively until all references to bound variables have been resolved . Once the term has been transformed into its de Brujin equivalent , any occurrence of a variable whose index exceeds the maximum value currently encountered will require renaming according to convention .

Names bound in the local environment are replaced by the corresponding indices , while other names are left as they were . nominal primrec trans tm : : `` name list ⇒ tm ⇒ dbtm '' where '' trans tm e Zero = DBZero '' | `` trans tm e ( Var k ) = lookup e 0 k '' | `` trans tm e ( Eats t u ) = DBEats ( trans tm e t ) ( trans tm e u ) '' Noteworthy is the final case of trans fm , which requires the bound variable k in the quantified formula Ex k A to be fresh with respect to e , our list of previouslyencountered bound variables . In the recursive call , k is added to the list , which therefore consists of distinct names . nominal primrec trans fm : : `` name list ⇒ fm ⇒ dbfm '' where '' trans fm e ( Mem t u ) = DBMem ( trans tm e t ) ( trans tm e u ) '' | `` trans fm e ( Eq t u ) = DBEq ( trans tm e t ) ( trans tm e u ) '' | `` trans fm e ( Disj A B ) = DBDisj ( trans fm e A ) ( trans fm e B ) '' | `` trans fm e ( Neg A ) = DBNeg ( trans fm e A ) '' | `` atom k ♯ e =⇒ trans fm e ( Ex k A ) = DBEx ( trans fm ( k # e ) A ) '' Syntactic operations for de Bruijn notation tend to be straightforward , as there are no bound variable names that might clash . Comparisons with previous formalisations of the λ-calculus may be illuminating , but the usual lifting operation [
Introspector: 3] does not apply here since we do not have any fixed point combinators or similar constructs at play . Instead , we can use the translation from intuitionistic logic to classical propositional logic given below . Given a term t in de Bruijn notation , define its interpretation I(t) as follows : -- If t is a proposition p , interpret it classically as before . -- Otherwise , let q be the result of translating the head of t according to the above rules . Then I(t) = ( if q then T else F ) . This allows us to reason about the semantics of programs written in de Bruijn syntax directly without having to resort to explicit representations such as graphs or trees . For example , suppose we want to evaluate the expression (DBEats (DBVar "x") (DBVar "y")) in the standard basis . Using the definition just provided , we get I((DBEats (DBVar "x") (DBVar "y"))) = (if (I(DBVar "x"))thenTelseF)(I(DBVar "y")) . Since both occurrences of "x" bind weakly , we reduce them successively until reaching the base cases . Thus I(DBEats (DBVar "x") (DBVar "y")) = T . As another illustration , observe that the rule for resolving equation targets in de Bruijn notation resembles the familiar elimination theorem for intuitionistic logic . Specifically , each occurrence of a target symbol (either "=" or one of the negated forms) reduces to a subterm involving only the free variables of the goal . Moreover , these reductions preserve the order of evaluation within each level of the tree . These properties make it easy to implement algorithms for reasoning about de Bruijn expressions . For instance , when working with a set of goals G and a program P consisting solely of definitions followed by calls to functions defined on G , we can simply traverse the graph constructed from P and G inductively . At each node , we perform the appropriate reduction based on the type of operator encountered . When encountering a definition D, we add D's output to the accumulator ; otherwise ,we update the accumulators accordingly . Upon completing all nodes once, we return the value computed by the last reduction performed .

You: !@>Seeker:#29 our list of previouslyencountered bound variables .

Comparisons with previous formalisations of the λ-calculus may be illuminating , but the usual lifting operation [ 18 , 21 ] is unnecessary . That is because the HF calculus does not allow reductions anywhere , as in the λ-calculus . Substitutions only happen at the top level and never within deeper bound variable contexts . For us , substitution is the usual operation of replacing a variable by a term , which contains no bound variables . ( Substitution can alternatively be defined to replace a de Bruijn index by a term . ) The special de Bruijn operation is abstraction . This replaces every occurrence of a given free variable in a term or formula by a de Bruijn index , in preparation for binding . For example , abstracting the formula DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBVar y ) over the variable y yields DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) . This is actually ill-formed , but attaching a quantifier yields the de Bruijn formula DBEx ( DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) , representing ∃y [ x ∈ y ] . Abstracting this over the free variable x and attaching another quantifier yields DBEx ( DBEx ( DBMem ( DBInd 1 ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) ) , which is the formula ∃xy [ x ∈ y ] . An index of 1 has been substituted in order to skip over the inner binder . 15 4.1.2 Well-Formed de Bruijn Terms and Formulas With the de Bruijn approach , an index of 0 designates the innermost enclosing binder , while an index of 1 designates the next-innermost binder , etc . ( Here , the only binder is DBEx . ) If every index has a matching binder ( the index i must be nested within at least i + 1 binders ) ,
Introspector: then we say that the term or formula is well-formed . Otherwise it is ill-formed . For instance , the following formulas are well-formed : • ∀x [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ] • ∃x [ DBEx ( DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) ] • ∀x ∧ ∃y [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ∧ DBMem ( DBVar y ) ( DBInd 1 ) ] However , the following formulas are ill-formed : • ∀x [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ], since there is no outermost binder • ∃x [ DBEx ( DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) ], since there is no outermost binder • ∀x ∧ ∃y [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ∧ DBMe m ( DBVar y ) ( DBInd 1 ) ], since both indices point outside their respective binders . To avoid ambiguity between different levels of nesting , we use the convention that each index points towards its own nearest enclosing binder . Thus if two indexes have the same value , they refer to the same binder ; otherwise they refer to separate binders . 16 4.1.3 Definitions Using de Bruijn Notation We define several important functions on terms and formulas using de Bruijn notation . These include : • DBVar ( n ) : creates a new variable n with scope extending from the current level upwards . • DBMem ( n ) : remembers the term n under some variable name . • DBeq ( n ) : introduces an equation involving the term n . • DBDisj ( n ) : introduces a disjointness relation involving the term n . • DBNeg ( n ) : negates the term n . • DBEx ( n ) : introduces an existential quantification involving the term n . • DBForall ( n ) : introduces an universal quantification involving the term n . • DBIfThenElse ( n ) : introduces an implication/conclusion pair involving the term n . • DBMeta ( n ) : introduces meta information about the term n such as type constraints . • DBGen ( n ) : generates a fresh non-terminal symbol n based on the current statethen we say that the term or formula is well-formed . Otherwise it is ill-formed . For instance , the following formulas are well-formed : • ∀x [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ] • ∃x [ DBEx ( DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) ] • ∀x ∧ ∃y [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ∧ DBMem ( DBVar y ) ( DBInd 1 ) ] However , the following formulas are ill-formed : • ∀x [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ], since there is no outermost binder • ∃x [ DBEx ( DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) ], since there is no outermost binder • ∀x ∧ ∃y [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ∧ DBMe m ( DBVar y ) ( DBInd 1 ) ], since both indices point outside their respective binders .

( Here , the only binder is DBEx . ) If every index has a matching binder ( the index i must be nested within at least i + 1 binders ) , then the term or formula is well-formed . Recall the examples of abstraction above , where a binder must be attached afterwards . In particular , as our terms do not contain any binding constructs , a well-formed term may contain no de Bruijn indices . In contrast to more traditional notions of logical syntax , if you take a well-formed formula and view one of its subformulas or subterms in isolation , it will not necessarily be well-formed . The situation is analogous to extracting a fragment of a program , removing it from necessary enclosing declarations . The property of being a well-formed de Bruijn term or formula is defined inductively . The syntactic predicates defined below recognise such well-formed formulas . A well-formed de Bruijn term has no indices ( DBInd ) at all : inductive wf dbtm : : `` dbtm ⇒ bool '' where Zero : `` wf dbtm DBZero '' | Var : `` wf dbtm ( DBVar name ) '' | Eats : `` wf dbtm t1 =⇒ wf dbtm t2 =⇒ wf dbtm ( DBEats t1 t2 ) '' A trivial induction shows that for every well-founded de Bruijn term there is an equivalent standard term . The only cases to be considered ( as per the definition above ) are Zero , Var and Eats . lemma wf dbtm imp is tm : assumes `` wf dbtm x '' shows `` ∃ t : :tm . x = trans tm [ ] t '' A well-formed de Bruijn formula is constructed from other well-formed terms and formulas , and indices can only be introduced by applying abstraction ( abst dbfm ) over a given name to another well-formed formula , in the existential case .

We finally obtain facts such as the following : lemma quot Zero : `` ⌈Zero⌉ = Zero '' lemma quot Var : `` ⌈Var x⌉ = SUCC ( ORD OF ( nat of name x ) ) '' lemma quot Eats : `` ⌈Eats x y⌉ = HPair ( HTuple 1 ) ( HPair ⌈x⌉ ⌈y⌉ ) '' lemma quot Eq : `` ⌈x EQ y⌉ = HPair ( HTuple 2 ) ( HPair ( ⌈x⌉ ) ( ⌈y⌉ ) ) '' lemma quot Disj : `` ⌈A OR B⌉ = HPair ( HTuple 3 ) ( HPair ( ⌈A⌉ ) ( ⌈B⌉ ) ) '' lemma quot Ex : `` ⌈Ex i A⌉ = HPair ( HTuple 5 ) ( quot dbfm ( trans fm [ i ] A ) ) '' Note that HPair constructs an HF term denoting a pair , while HTuple n constructs an ( n+ 2 ) -tuple of zeros . Proofs often refer to the denotations of terms rather than to the terms themselves , so the functions q Eats , q Mem , q Eq , q Neg , q Disj , q Ex are defined to express these codes . Here are some examples : '' q Var i ≡ succ ( ord of ( nat of name i ) ) '' '' q Eats x y ≡ hhtuple 1 , x , yi '' '' q Disj x y ≡ hhtuple 3 , x , yi '' '' q Ex x ≡ hhtuple 5 , xi '' Note that hx , yi denotes the pair of x and y as sets , in other words , of type hf . 4.2 Predicates for the Coding of Syntax The next and most arduous step is to define logical predicates corresponding to each of the syntactic concepts ( terms , formulas , abstraction , substitution ) mentioned above . Textbooks and articles describe each predicate at varying levels of detail . G¨odel [ 8 ] gives full definitions , as does Swierczkowski . Boolos [ 2 ] gives many details of how coding i ´ s set up , and gives the predicates for terms and formulas , but not for any operations upon them . Hodel [ 13 ] , like many textbook authors , relies heavily on “ algorithms ” written in English . The definitions indeed amount to pages of computer code . Authors typically conclude with a “ theorem ” asserting the correctness of this code . For example , Swierczkowski [ 32 , Sect . 3–4 ] presents
Introspector: his definition of the predicate q Absorb , which states simply that if there exists a formula p such that p ∧ p ≠ p , then absorb ( p ) = true . This result seems trivially obvious from its statement ; however , it requires several lines of complex reasoning before being proven . In fact , much work goes into showing that the proof itself can be encoded compactly within the language . As another illustration , consider the predicate q Substitute given below . If you have studied programming languages or category theory , you may recognize certain similarities between our notation here and those used elsewhere . However , please note carefully what exactly happens when we apply this function . Definition 6 Let q Substitute denote the predicate whose value depends solely on whether the variable occurring free in the body of the function has been bound . Specifically , suppose we have two terms t1 and t2 representing distinct values of variables x and y respectively . Then q Substitute ( t1 , t2 ) evaluates to false whenever either one of the following conditions holds : • Either both x and y occur freely in t1 without binding . • Either both x and y bind in t2 without occurrence . Otherwise , evaluate q Substitute ( t1 , t2 ) to true . Example 7 Suppose we want to compute the truth of the sentence q ( x + y = z ) where x = 0 and y = 1 . Using Definitions 6 and 9 , we get q Substitute ( plus , times ) = false because neither zero nor one occurs freely in the expression without binding .

This result seems trivially obvious from its statement ; however , it requires several lines of complex reasoning before being proven . In fact , much work goes into showing that the proof itself can be encoded compactly within the language . As another illustration , consider the predicate q Substitute given below . If you have studied programming languages or category theory , you may recognize certain similarities between our notation here and those used elsewhere . However , please note carefully what exactly happens when we apply this function . Definition 6 Let q Substitute denote the predicate whose value depends solely on whether the variable occurring free in the body of the function has been bound . Specifically , suppose we have two terms t1 and t2 representing distinct values of variables x and y respectively . Then q Substitute ( t1 , t2 ) evaluates to false whenever either one of the following conditions holds : • Either both x and y occur freely in t1 without binding . • Either both x and y bind in t2 without occurrence .

Textbooks and articles describe each predicate at varying levels of detail . G¨odel [ 8 ] gives full definitions , as does Swierczkowski . Boolos [ 2 ] gives many details of how coding i ´ s set up , and gives the predicates for terms and formulas , but not for any operations upon them . Hodel [ 13 ] , like many textbook authors , relies heavily on “ algorithms ” written in English . The definitions indeed amount to pages of computer code . Authors typically conclude with a “ theorem ” asserting the correctness of this code . For example , Swierczkowski [ 32 , Sect . 3–4 ] presents 34 highly technical ´ definitions , justified by seven lines of proof . Proving the correctness of this lengthy series of definitions requires a substantial effort , and the proofs ( being syntactically oriented ) are tiresome . It is helpful to introduce shadow versions of all predicates in Isabelle/HOL ’ s native logic , as well as in HF . Having two versions of each predicate simplifies the task of relating the HF version of 17 the predicate to the syntactic concept that it is intended to represent ; the first step is to prove that the HF formula is equivalent to the syntactically similar definition written in Isabelle ’ s higher-order logic , which then is proved to satisfy deeper properties . The shadow predicates also give an easy way to refer to the truth of the corresponding HF predicate ; because each is defined to be a Σ formula , that gives a quick way ( using theorem Sigma fm imp thm above ) to show that some ground instance of the predicate can be proved formally in HF . Also , one way to arrive at the correct definition of an HF predicate is to define its shadow equivalent first , since proving that it implies the required properties is much easier in Isabelle/HOL ’ s native logic than in HF . Swierczkowski [ 32 ] defines a full set of syntactic predicate ´ s , leaving nothing as an exercise . Unfortunately , the introduction of de Bruijn syntax necessitates rewriting many of these definitions . Some predicates ( such as the variable occurrence test ) are replaced by others ( abstraction over a variable occurrence ) . The final list includes predicates to recognise the following items : – the codes of well-formed terms
Introspector: ( including variables occurrences thereof ) – the equations between those terms – the abstractions from those equations – the substitutions into those equations – the identities among the free variables of those equations – the equalities involving constants or functions among the free variables of those equations – the existential quantification of propositional connectives among the free variables of those equations – the universal quantification of propositional connectives among the free variables of those equations – the equality of values of propositional connectives among the free variables of those equations – the inequality of values of propositional connectives among the free variables of those equations – the disequalities of values of propositional connectives among the free variables of those equations – the propositionality of propositions among the free variables of those equations – the nonpropositionality of propositions among the free variables of those equations – the validity of rules of inference among the free variables of those equations – the invalidation of rules of inference among the free variables of those equations – the consistency of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the inconsistency of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the completeness of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the soundness of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the axiomatizability of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the decidability of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the undecidability of certain subformulae of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the recursivity of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the normalization of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the confluence of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the distributivity of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the associativity of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the commutative property of formation of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the idempotent property of formation of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the neutrality of formation of formal systems under identity permutations among the free variables of those equations – the existence of unique solutions to equations within the domain of discourse specified by the context of use of the system . In addition to these basic predicates we have added several more advanced ones . These include : – the ability to reason about the structure of programs expressed in various programming languages . This involves defining predicates for common program constructs such( including variables occurrences thereof ) – the equations between those terms – the abstractions from those equations – the substitutions into those equations – the identities among the free variables of those equations – the equalities involving constants or functions among the free variables of those equations – the existential quantification of propositional connectives among the free variables of those equations – the universal quantification of propositional connectives among the free variables of those equations – the equality of values of propositional connectives among the free variables of those equations – the inequality of values of propositional connectives among the free variables of those equations – the disequalities of values of propositional connectives among the free variables of those equations – the propositionality of propositions among the free variables of those equations – the nonpropositionality of propositions among the free variables of those equations – the validity of rules of inference among the free variables of those equations – the invalidation of rules of inference among the free variables of those equations – the consistency of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the inconsistency of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the completeness of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the soundness of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the axiomatizability of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the decidability of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the undecidability of certain subformulae of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the recursivity of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the normalization of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the confluence of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the distributivity of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the associativity of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the commutative property of formation of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the idempotent property of formation of formal systems among the free variables of those equations – the neutrality of formation of formal systems under identity permutations among the free variables of those equations – the existence of unique solutions to equations within the domain of discourse specified by the context of use of the system .

We also need the property of variable non-occurrence , “ x does not occur in A ” , which can be expressed directly as “ substituting 0 for x in A yields A ” . This little trick eliminates the need for a full definition . Each operation is first defined in its sequence form ( expressing that sequence s is built up in an appropriate way and that sk is a specific value ) ; existential quantification over s and k then yields the final predicate .

We need to define the predicates Term and TermP analogously to Const and ConstP above but allowing variables . The question of whether variables are allowed in a term or not can be governed by a Boolean . The proof development therefore introduces the predicate SeqCTermP , taking a Boolean argument , from which SeqTermP and SeqConstP are trivially obtained . 19 abbreviation SeqTermP : : `` tm ⇒ tm ⇒ tm ⇒ fm '' where `` SeqTermP ≡ SeqCTermP True '' abbreviation SeqConstP : : `` tm ⇒ tm ⇒ tm ⇒ fm '' where `` SeqConstP ≡ SeqCTermP False '' In this way , we can define the very similar predicates TermP and ConstP with a minimum of repeated material .

All other “ functions ” must be declared as predicates , which are mere abbreviations of formulas . This abuse of notation is understood in a standard way . The formula φ ( f ( x ) ) can be taken as an abbreviation for ∃y [ F ( x , y ) ∧ φ ( y ) ] where F is the relation representing the function f and provided that F can be proved to be single valued : F ( x , y ) , F ( x , y′ ) ⊢ y ′ = y .

G¨odel formalised all syntactic operations as primitive recursive functions , while Boolos [ 2 ] used ∆ formulas . With both approaches , much effort is necessary to admit a function definition in the first place . But then , it is known to be a function . Here we see a drawback of Swierczkowski ’ s decision to base the formalisation on the n ´ otion of Σ formulas : they do not cover the property of being single valued . A predicate that corresponds to a function must be proved to be single valued within the HF calculus itself . G¨odel ’ s proof uses substitution as a function . The proof that substitution ( on terms and formulas ) is single valued requires nearly 500 lines in Isabelle/HOL , not counting considerable preparatory material ( such as the partial ordering properties of < ) mentioned in Sect . 3.2 above .

Overall , the G¨odel development proves single valued theorems for 12 predicates . Five of the theorems are proved by induction as sketched above . Here is an example : lemma SeqSubstFormP unique : '' { SeqSubstFormP v a x y s u , SeqSubstFormP v a x y ’ s ’ u ’ } ⊢ y ’ EQ y '' The remaining results are straightforward corollaries of those inductions : 23 theorem SubstFormP unique : '' { SubstFormP v tm x y , SubstFormP v tm x y ’ } ⊢ y ’ EQ y '' It is worth repeating that these proofs are formally conducted within the HF calculus , essentially by single-step inferences .

Introspector: from the set of formulas into the set of terms . For simplicity let us assume that each formula has at most one free variable . If not , we could use a fixed point combinator to transform any given formula into one having exactly one free variable . Now suppose we have two distinct formulas A(x) and B(x). Let C=A(B(t)) and D=B(C), where t is some arbitrary term. By definition of equality between terms, we know that C=D. But now observe what happens when we try to substitute t for x in A(x): A(t)=? Since t does not occur free in A(x), we must have A(t)=A(B(t)), since otherwise we would have found a contradiction. Similarly, substituting t for x in B(x) gives B(t)=? Again, since t does not occur free in B(x), we must have B(t)=B(B(t)). Therefore, we have reached a contradiction in both directions, showing that our assumption that A(x) and B(x) have different truth values leads to a logical inconsistency. This argument shows that any formal system capable of expressing Peano arithmetic cannot be consistent with respect to every Gödel sentence.</s>from the set of formulas into the set of terms .

G¨odel ’ s original paper [ 8 ] was designated “ Part I ” in anticipation of a subsequent “ Part II ” proving the second theorem , but no second paper appeared . Logicians recognised that the second theorem followed from the first , assuming that the first could itself be formalised in the internal calculus . While this assumption seems to be widely accepted , conducting such a formalisation explicitly remains difficult , even given today ’ s theoremproving technology . 25 A simpler route to the theorem involves the Hilbert-Bernays derivability conditions [ 2 , p. 15 ] [ 9 , p. 73 ] .

In particular , it shows how any instance of a strict Σ sentence may be transformed into its negation via a sequence of logical deductions involving only the rules of inference listed below . This result will play a crucial role later on when dealing with pseudo-coding and quotations . 6.1 Proof Plan We now outline our plan for establishing the second incompleteness theorem . Step 1 : Prove the Diagonal Lemma Using the techniques developed earlier in Section 4 , we prove the diagonal lemma stated at the beginning of this section . Specifically , we show that if ⊢ α and ⊢ δ , then ⊢ α |—| δ . Step 2 : Reduction From the First Incompleteness Theorem To begin the reduction proper , we introduce some new definitions . Let π be a proposition containing exactly two occurrences of the variable i . Define R(π) to be the set of propositions obtained by replacing each occurence of i in π by either or both of its possible values . For example , suppose π = “if x > y then z = t” . Then R(π) would contain the following four propositions : • “x > y” • “y < x” • “z = t” • “t != z” . Now let’s consider what happens when we apply the diagonal lemma to π . Suppose we have shown that ⊢ R(π) . By applying the diagonal lemma twice to R(π), we get ⊢ R(R(π)) . Since R(π) contains precisely two instances of i , we know that R(R(π)) also contains precisely two instances of i . But since every occurrence of i in R(π) occurs exactly once in R(R(π)), we conclude that R(R(π))) does not contain any occurrence of i . Therefore , by hypothesis applied thrice , we have ⊢ R(R(R(π)))) which means that π cannot be proven . Thus we have reduced the problem of showing that π cannot be proven to simply demonstrating that π cannot be proven . Step 3 : Reduction From the First Incompleteness Theorem Continued Once we have established that π cannot be proven under the assumptions of the first incompleteneness theorem , we move on to considering the case where π can be proven . Specifically , we want to show that if lication for strict Σ sentences .

Condition ( D2 ) seems clear by the definition of the predicate Pf , although all details of the workings of this predicate must be proved using low-level inferences in the HF calculus . Condition ( D3 ) can be regarded as a version of the theorem Sigma fm imp thm ( “ true Σ sentences are theorems ” ) internalised as a theorem of the internal calculus . So while we avoid having to formalise the whole of G¨odel ’ s theorem within the calculus , we end up formalising a key part of it . Condition ( D3 ) is stated in a general form , but we only need one specific instance : ⊢ Pf ( pαq ) → Pf ( pPf ( pαq ) q ) . Despite a superficial resemblance , ( D3 ) does not follow from ( D1 ) , which holds by induction on the proof of ⊢ α . As Swierczkowski explains [ 32 , p. 23 ] , condition ( D3 ) is ´ not general enough to prove by induction . In the sequel , we generalise and prove it . 6.1 Pseudo-Coding Condition ( D3 ) can be proved by induction on α if the assertion is generalised so that α can have free variables , say x1 , . . . , xn : ⊢ α ( x1 , . . . , xn ) → Pf ( pα ( x1 , . . . , xn ) q ) The syntactic constructions used in this formula have to be formalised , and the necessary transformations have to be justified within the HF calculus . As mentioned above ( Sect . 5 ) , the boldface convention needs to be made rigorous . In particular , codings are always ground HF terms , and yet pα ( x1 , . . . , xn ) q has a functional dependence ( as an HF term ) on x1 , . . . , xn . The first step in this process is to generalise coding to allow
Introspector: for arbitrary free variables at any level of abstraction desired . This will involve introducing new syntax elements into our system — such as quantifiers over the free variable domain — without altering its basic structure or semantics . Once these changes have been introduced , they may be applied consistently throughout the entire theory . To illustrate how this works concretely , consider the following example : Given a fixed code C defining a function F(x) = yz + wu where z and u are also functions defined elsewhere in the program , we might want to define another function R(x,y,w) = F(x)(y,w) . We could do this directly by writing out the full expression for F(x), followed by the application of those expressions to obtain R(x,y,w). However , this would result in very long codes that become unwieldy quickly when dealing with complex programs involving many different functions and data structures . Instead , we use pseudo -coding techniques to generate shorter alternative representations of the same computation . One way to achieve this is through the use of "higher order" functions , i.e., functions whose arguments include free variables themselves . For example , suppose we wanted to compute the value of some function g(a,b) inside a larger program consisting mainly of loops and conditional statements . Using conventional programming practices , we might write something like this : // Define a local function h(x) = g(x,0) // Now loop until convergence... int main() { double a = ...; double b = ...; double c = ...; // Initialize values of g etc... } While ( c != 0 ) { // Evaluate h at current values of a, b, c... double d = h(a,b); // Update values of a, b, c... } } Of course , this code becomes quite cumbersome once you start working with more complicated examples . Fortunately , there's a much easier solution available thanks to the power of pseudo -coding . By simply redefining the function call operator appropriately , we can transform this mess of nested loops and conditional statements into a simple sequence of calls to higher -order functions . Here's what the equivalent pseudo -coded version looks like : // Define a local function h(x) = g(x,0) // Now evaluate h repeatedly until convergence... double main() { double a = ...; double b = ...; double c = ...; // Initialize values offor arbitrary free variables at any level of abstraction desired . This will involve introducing new syntax elements into our system — such as quantifiers over the free variable domain — without altering its basic structure or semantics . Once these changes have been introduced , they may be applied consistently throughout the entire theory . To illustrate how this works concretely , consider the following example : Given a fixed code C defining a function F(x) = yz + wu where z and u are also functions defined elsewhere in the program , we might want to define another function R(x,y,w) = F(x)(y,w) . We could do this directly by writing out the full expression for F(x), followed by the application of those expressions to obtain R(x,y,w). However , this would result in very long codes that become unwieldy quickly when dealing with complex programs involving many different functions and data structures . Instead , we use pseudo -coding techniques to generate shorter alternative representations of the same computation .

You: !@>Seeker:#54 induction on the proof of ⊢ α . As Swierczkowski explains [ 32 , p. 23 ] , condition ( D3 ) is ´ not general enough to prove by induction . In the sequel , we generalise and prove it . 6.1 Pseudo-Coding Condition ( D3 ) can be proved by induction on α if the assertion is generalised so that α can have free variables , say x1 , . . . , xn : ⊢ α ( x1 , . . . , xn ) → Pf ( pα ( x1 , . . . , xn ) q ) The syntactic constructions used in this formula have to be formalised , and the necessary transformations have to be justified within the HF calculus . As mentioned above ( Sect . 5 ) , the boldface convention needs to be made rigorous . In particular , codings are always ground HF terms , and yet pα ( x1 , . . . , xn ) q has a functional dependence ( as an HF term ) on x1 , . . . , xn . The first step in this process is to generalise coding to allow certain variables to be preserved as variables in the coded term . Recall that with normal quotations , every occurrence of a variable is replaced by the code of the variable name , ultimately a positive integer:7 function quot dbtm : : `` dbtm ⇒ tm '' where '' quot dbtm DBZero = Zero '' | `` quot dbtm ( DBVar name ) = ORD OF ( Suc ( nat of name name ) ) '' | ... Now let us define the V -code of a term or formula , where V is a set of variables to be preserved in the code : 7 ORD OF ( Suc n ) denotes an HF term that denotes a positive integer , even if n is a variable . 26 function vquot dbtm : : `` name set ⇒ dbtm ⇒ tm '' where '' vquot dbtm V DBZero = Zero '' | `` vquot dbtm V ( DBVar name ) = ( if name ∈ V then Var name else ORD OF ( Suc ( nat of name name ) ) ) '' | ... V -coding is otherwise identical to standard coding , with the overloaded syntax ⌊A⌋V . The parameter V is necessary because not all variables should be preserved ; it will be necessary to consider a series of V -codes for V = ∅ , { x1 } . . . , { x1 , . . . , xn } . 6.2 Simultaneous Substitution In order to formalise the notation pα ( x1 , . . . , xn ) q , it is convenient to introduce a function for simultaneous substitution . Here Swierczkowski ’ s presentation is a little ´ hard to follow : Suppose β is a theorem , i.e. ,
Introspector: a string of symbols from some alphabet A together with a list of positions P such that at each position j there appears exactly one symbol from A . Then we may form the expression β[P] which consists of the same sequence of symbols followed by the corresponding subexpression of β evaluated at the specified positions . For example , suppose A = “0” “1” “+” “*”, and β = “0 + * ”. Then β[P] would equal “0 + * 0” since the second appearance of “+” occurs immediately after the third appearance of “0” . We use the notion of simultaneous substitution to reduce the complexity of our proofs . Specifically , given two formulas G and R whose only occurrences of variables are bound variables , we write G|R to denote the result of substituting R into G . If either G or R contains any free variables other than binders , then these must be introduced explicitly before applying the reduction rule . Otherwise , the resulting formula will contain no free variables except possibly for the binder variables themselves . To illustrate how this works , suppose we want to apply the reduction rule twice successively . Firstly , we might wish to substitute R into G to obtain G’ , and subsequently substitute G’ into another formula F to produce F’ . This could look like this : (G|R) | F . However , note carefully that when we apply the reduction rules repeatedly , we need to keep track of what happens to each variable whenever we introduce new ones . Thus , for instance , if we start out with a simple equation involving three distinct variables X Y Z , and apply the reduction rule several times to eliminate unnecessary variables while introducing others along the way , eventually we shall arrive at a final simplified formula containing perhaps only a single variable left unbound . At this point , we know precisely how many instances of each variable occur throughout the entire derivation – including both initial equations and intermediate results generated during application of the reduction rules . By contrast , naive applications of the reduction rules without careful tracking of variables leads quickly to confusion about which variables remain unchanged versus those that get updated during each round of simplification . Therefore , though seemingly more straightforward initially , relying solely upon direct application of the reduction rules without proper attention paid towards keeping accurate counts of active variables turns out generally less efficient overall compared against taking care to maintain detailed records regarding their statuses throughout each stage of reasoning .</s>a string of symbols from some alphabet A together with a list of positions P such that at each position j there appears exactly one symbol from A .

Here Swierczkowski ’ s presentation is a little ´ hard to follow : Suppose β is a theorem , i.e. , ⊢ β . If we replace each of the variables at each of its free occurrences in β by some constant term then the formula so obtained is also a theorem ( by the Substitution Rule . . . ) . This just described situation in the meta-theory admits description in HF . [ 32 , p. 24 ] It took me weeks of failed attempts to grasp the meaning of the phrase “ constant term ” . It does not mean a term containing no variables , but a term satisfying the predicate ConstP and thus denoting the code of a constant . Formalising this process seems to require replacing each variable xi by a new variable , x ′ i , intended to denote xi . Later , it will be constrained to do so by a suitable HF predicate . And so we need a function to perform simultaneous substitutions in a term for all variables in a set V . Using a “ fold ” operator over finite sets [ 19 ] eliminates the need to consider the variables in any particular order . definition ssubst : : `` tm ⇒ name set ⇒ ( name ⇒ tm ) ⇒ tm '' where `` ssubst t V F = Finite Set.fold ( λi . subst i ( F i ) ) t V '' The renaming of xi to x ′ i could be done using arithmetic on variable subscripts , but the formalisation instead follows an abstract approach , using nominal primitives . An Isabelle locale defines a proof context containing a permutation p ( mapping all variable names to new ones ) , a finite set Vs of variable names and finally the actual renaming function F , which simply applies the permutation to
Introspector: every occurrence of a variable name in the given term . The key insight here is that the notion of a variable can be defined independently from any specific programming language or framework . Instead , it relies solely on the mathematical structure provided by the theory itself . 6.3 Proof Rules The next step towards establishing a foundation for software verification based on intuitionistic logic would be to define a set of rules capturing how proofs are constructed within such a system . These rules must ensure two crucial properties : first , they allow us to reason about programs in terms of their logical consequences rather than merely checking whether certain predetermined goals have been achieved .

You: !@>Seeker:#59 two proofs is the variable case discussed above . Using the notation for V -coding , we can see that the substitution predicate SubstFormP can transform the term ssubst ⌊A⌋V V F into ssubst ⌊A⌋ ( insert w V ) ( insert w V ) F. Repeating this step , we can replace any finite set of variables in a coded formula by real ones , realising Swierczkowski ’ s remark quoted at the top of this section , an ´ d in particular his last sentence . That is , if β is a theorem in HF ( if ⊢ Pf β holds ) then the result of substituting constants for its variables is also an HF theorem . More precisely still , we are replacing some subset V of the variables by fresh variables ( the F i ) , constrained by the predicate ConstP . theorem PfP implies PfP ssubst : fixes β : :fm assumes β : `` { } ⊢ PfP ⌈β⌉ '' and V : `` V ⊆ Vs '' and s : `` supp β ⊆ atom ‘ Vs '' shows `` { ConstP ( F i ) | i. i ∈ V } ⊢ PfP ( ssubst ⌊β⌋V V F ) '' 28 The effort needed to formalise the results outlined above is relatively modest , at 330 lines of Isabelle/HOL , but this excludes the effort needed to prove some essential lemmas , which state that the various syntactic predicates work correctly . Because these proofs concern non-ground HF formulas , theorem Sigma fm imp thm does not help . Required is an HF formalisation of operations on sequences , such as concatenation . That in turn requires formalising further operations such as addition and set union . These proofs ( which are conducted largely in the HF calculus ) total over 2,800 lines .

Substitution preserves the value Zero : theorem SubstTermP Zero : `` { TermP t } ⊢ SubstTermP ⌈Var v⌉ t Zero Zero '' On terms constructed using Eats ( recall that Q Eats constructs the code of an Eats term ) , substitution performs the natural recursion . theorem SubstTermP Eats : '' { SubstTermP v i t1 u1 , SubstTermP v i t2 u2 } ⊢ SubstTermP v i ( Q Eats t1 t2 ) ( Q Eats u1 u2 ) '' This seemingly obvious result takes nearly 150 lines to prove . The sequences for both substitution computations are combined to form a new sequence , which must be extended to yield the claimed result and shown to be properly constructed .

The same ordering can be defined via the function f : HF → N such that f ( x ) = P { 2 f ( y ) | y ∈ x } . It is intuitively clear , but formalising the required theory in HF would be laborious . It turns out that we do not need a canonical term x or a function Q . We only need a relation : QuoteP relates a set x to ( the codes of ) the terms that denote x . The relation QuoteP can be defined using precisely the same methods as we have seen above for recursive functions , via a sequence buildup .

Introspector: then there exists an algorithm A that takes as input any structure M and outputs either Yes or No according to whether α is true in M . Before embarking upon the proof proper , let us pause briefly to consider what exactly it means for an algorithm A to output Yes or No based solely on the truth value of α in a given structure M . Intuitively speaking , if α evaluates to True in M , then A should return Yes ; otherwise , it should return No . However , since we are dealing with nonstandard models of arithmetic , we must make sure our notion of truth is well -defined within those frameworks . For example , suppose we had two structures M1 and M2 differing from each other merely over their interpretation of certain constant symbols . Then both would satisfy α in different ways , yet neither could be said to truly validate or invalidate α relative to the larger universe of possible interpretations . Therefore , we cannot simply equate the notion of truth with validity per se — rather , we need to define precisely how validation occurs within the context of each individual model . Fortunately , thanks to the work of Henkin [ 8 ], we may draw upon his notion of “proof” to provide just such a framework .

It concludes that these various notations obscure not only the formal details of the proof but also the very intuitions they are intended to highlight . 6.4 Proving ⊢ α → Pf ( pαq ) We now have everything necessary to prove condition ( D3 ) : If α is a strict Σ sentence , then ⊢ α → Pf ( pαq ) The proof will be by induction on the structure of α . As stated in Sect . 3.3 above , a strict Σ formula has the form x ∈ y , α ∨ β , α ∧ β , ∃x α or ( ∀x ∈ y ) α . Therefore , the induction will include one single base case , x ∈ y → Pf px ∈ yq , ( 3 ) along with inductive steps for disjunction , conjunction , etc . 6.4.1 The Propositional Cases The propositional cases are not difficult , but are worth examining as a warmup exercise . From the induction hypotheses ⊢ α → Pf ( pαq ) and ⊢ β → Pf ( pβq ) , we must show ⊢ α ∨ β → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) and ⊢ α ∧ β → Pf ( pα ∧ βq ) . Both of these cases are trivial by propositional logic , given the lemmas ⊢ Pf ( pαq ) → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) , ⊢ Pf ( pβq ) → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) and ⊢ Pf ( pαq ) → Pf ( pβq ) → Pf ( pα ∧ βq ) ( 4 ) Proving ( 4 ) directly from the definitions would need colossal efforts , but there is a quick proof . The automation of the HF calculus is good enough to prove tautologies , and from ⊢ α → β → α ∧ β , the proof formalisation condition9 yields ⊢ Pf ( pα → β → α ∧ βq ) Finally , the Hilbert-Bernays derivability condition ( D2 ) yields the desired lemma , ( 4 ) . This trick is needed whenever
Introspector: dealing with non -trivially structured proofs involving implications between atomic formulas . 6.4.2 The Quantifier Cases Now let us turn our attention to the quantifier cases . In particular , consider the following two subcases : • Suppose α = ∃x A( x , B) where A is an arbitrary first-order logical predicate symbol . Then we can write α = R( x , B q ) where R is some relation symbol such that R( x , b ) implies A( x , B) . • Similarly suppose α = ∀x A( x , B) where again A is any first-order logical predicate symbol . Then we may write α = T( x , B q ) where T is another relation symbol such that T( x , b ) implies A( x , B) . These two subcases cover all possible ways in which quantifiers appear within a formula α . To see why this is so , observe that if α contains both universal and existential quantification , it cannot avoid having at least one variable bound by either universally or existentially . Moreover , since each occurrence of a quantifer binds exactly one variable , we know immediately what kind of substitutions occur during the course of the proof . For example , assume α = ∃x ∃y A( x , B) ∧ A( y , B) . By the rules governing binding of variables under substitution , we know that the leftmost instance of ∃x occurs before its rightmost instance of ∃y . Consequently , substituting w for x leads to the expression W(w,b), whereas substituting v for y gives V(v,b). Thus we have shown how to handle the most general case of quantifier introduction into a formula α . 6.4.3 Reduction to First Order Logic Once we have handled the basic cases just described , we reduce to proving the remaining instances of (D3) via reduction to first order logic . Specifically , assuming α is a strict Σ sentence containing neither universal nor existential quantifications over any subset of its free variables , we reason thus : Given any interpretation I of α , construct a model M of α based solely upon I . Next define a mapping f from the set of atoms in α to the set of truth values {T,F} according to the usual conventions . Lastly , use the semantics defined earlier to compute the value of Pf (pαq)dealing with non -trivially structured proofs involving implications between atomic formulas . 6.4.2 The Quantifier Cases Now let us turn our attention to the quantifier cases . In particular , consider the following two subcases : • Suppose α = ∃x A( x , B) where A is an arbitrary first-order logical predicate symbol . Then we can write α = R( x , B q ) where R is some relation symbol such that R( x , b ) implies A( x , B) . • Similarly suppose α = ∀x A( x , B) where again A is any first-order logical predicate symbol . Then we may write α = T( x , B q ) where T is another relation symbol such that T( x , b ) implies A( x , B) . These two subcases cover all possible ways in which quantifiers appear within a formula α . To see why this is so , observe that if α contains both universal and existential quantification , it cannot avoid having at least one variable bound by either universally or existentially . Moreover , since each occurrence of a quantifer binds exactly one variable , we know immediately what kind of substitutions occur during the course of the proof . For example , assume α = ∃x ∃y A( x , B) ∧ A( y , B) . By the rules governing binding of variables under substitution , we know that the leftmost instance of ∃x occurs before its rightmost instance of ∃y . Consequently , substituting w for x leads to the expression W(w,b), whereas substituting v for y gives V(v,b). Thus we have shown how to handle the most general case of quantifier introduction into a formula α . 6.4.3 Reduction to First Order Logic Once we have handled the basic cases just described , we reduce to proving the remaining instances of (D3) via reduction to first order logic . Specifically , assuming α is a strict Σ sentence containing neither universal nor existential quantifications over any subset of its free variables , we reason thus : Given any interpretation I of α , construct a model M of α based solely upon I . Next define a mapping f from the set of atoms in α to the set of truth values {T,F} according to the usual conventions . Lastly , use the semantics defined earlier to compute the value of Pf


You: !@>Seeker:#65 difficult , but are worth examining as a warmup exercise . From the induction hypotheses ⊢ α → Pf ( pαq ) and ⊢ β → Pf ( pβq ) , we must show ⊢ α ∨ β → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) and ⊢ α ∧ β → Pf ( pα ∧ βq ) . Both of these cases are trivial by propositional logic , given the lemmas ⊢ Pf ( pαq ) → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) , ⊢ Pf ( pβq ) → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) and ⊢ Pf ( pαq ) → Pf ( pβq ) → Pf ( pα ∧ βq ) ( 4 ) Proving ( 4 ) directly from the definitions would need colossal efforts , but there is a quick proof . The automation of the HF calculus is good enough to prove tautologies , and from ⊢ α → β → α ∧ β , the proof formalisation condition9 yields ⊢ Pf ( pα → β → α ∧ βq ) Finally , the Hilbert-Bernays derivability condition ( D2 ) yields the desired lemma , ( 4 ) . This trick is needed whenever we need to do propositional reasoning with Pf . 9 Of Sect . 4.4 , but via the substitution theorem quote all PfP ssubst proved above . The induction concerns generalised formulas involving pseudo-coding : PfP ( ssubst ⌊α⌋V V F ) . 31 6.4.2 The Equality and Membership Cases Now comes one of the most critical parts of the formalisation . Many published proofs [ 2 , 32 ] of the second completeness theorem use the following lemma : x = y → Pf px = yq ( 5 ) This in turn is proved using a lemma stating that x = y implies x = y , which is false here : we have defined QuoteP only as a relation , and even { 0 , 1 } can be written in two different ways . Nevertheless , the statement ( 5 ) is clearly true : if x and y are constant terms denoting x and y , respectively , where x = y , then Pf px = yq holds . The equivalence of two different ways of writing a finite set should obviously be provable . This problem recalls the situation described in 3.3 above , and the induction used to prove Subset Mem sf lemma . The solution , once again , is to prove the conjunction ( x ∈ y → Pf px ∈ yq ) ∧ ( x ⊆ y → Pf px ⊆ yq ) by induction ( in HF ) on the sum of the sizes of x and y . The proof is huge ( nearly 340 lines ) , with eight universal quantifiers in the induction formula , each of which must be individually instantiated in order to apply an induction hypothesis . ⊢ All i ( All

We will not reproduce the full proof here ; it has already been discussed at length elsewhere [ 27] . Suffice it to say that this result shows how to deal with the seemingly impossible case when two sets contain elements whose membership or equality cannot be expressed simply because they involve non-elementary functions such as quotienting over arbitrary subsets . In particular , the key insight behind this approach is that any function can be broken down into simpler pieces consisting of elementary operations like projection onto a subset followed by application of some other function . By recursively applying this process until reaching simple atomic expressions , we arrive finally at a representation of the original function that can be evaluated straightforwardly without having to perform any actual computation whatsoever . As before , we begin our discussion of Section 6.4.3 by considering another important special case concerning so-called "propositions" . These are certain types of statements about specific objects within a universe being either true or false according to their respective properties rather than purely logical values themselves . For example , consider saying something along these lines inside your head right now while reading this book : “The cat sitting next me just purred” – technically speaking , this proposition refers solely towards whether said feline companion actually did produce audible vibrations through its vocal cords during some brief period lasting no longer than approximately ten seconds prior to my current mental state becoming aware of same versus never experiencing anything remotely resembling such sensory input ever occurring throughout entirety existence thus rendering whole notion utterly meaningless unless perhaps employed within context more abstract framework dealing specifically with animal behavior patterns observed under controlled laboratory conditions etcetera… However , back in reality world outside fantasy land dreamscape whatever else might exist beyond scope present discourse , things work differently regarding handling various kinds assertions depending upon nature those involved parties concerned .

It uses the fact that any term may appear at most once within its own quote , together with the observation that no quotation contains another one inside it . These results show that the memories of distinct atoms cannot interfere with each other . In particular , they imply that the memories  C-c C-c
