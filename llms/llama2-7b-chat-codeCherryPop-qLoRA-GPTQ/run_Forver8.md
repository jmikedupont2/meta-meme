Paulson Abstract An Isabelle/HOL formalisation of G¨odel ’ s two incompleteness theorems is presented . The work follows Swierczkowski ’ s detailed proof of the theorems using hered ´ - itarily finite ( HF ) set theory [ 32 ] . Avoiding the usual arithmetical encodings of syntax eliminates the necessity to formalise elementary number theory within an embedded logical calculus . The Isabelle formalisation uses two separate treatments of variable binding : the nominal package [ 34 ] is shown to scale to a development of this complexity , while de Bruijn indices [ 3 ] turn out to be ideal for coding syntax . Critical details of the Isabelle proof are described , in particular gaps and errors found in the literature . 1 Introduction This paper describes mechanised proofs of G¨odel ’ s incompleteness theorems [ 8 ] , including the first mechanised proof of the second incompleteness theorem . Very informally , these results can be stated as follows : Theorem 1 ( First Incompleteness Theorem ) If L is a consistent theory capable of formalising a sufficient amount of elementary mathematics , then there is a sentence δ such that neither δ nor ¬δ is a theorem of L , and moreover , δ is true.1 Theorem 2 ( Second Incompleteness Theorem ) If L is as above and Con ( L ) is a sentence stating that L is consistent , then Con ( L ) is not a theorem of L. Both of these will be presented formally below . Let us start to examine what these theorems actually assert . They concern a consistent formal system , say L , based on firstorder logic with some additional axioms : G¨odel chose Peano arithmetic ( PA ) [ 7 ] , but hereditarily finite ( HF ) set theory is an alternative [ 32 ] , used here . The first theorem states that any such axiomatic system must be incomplete , in the sense that some sentence can neither be proved nor disproved . The expedient of adding that sentence as an axiom merely creates a new axiomatic system , for which there is another undecidable sentence . The theorem can be strengthened to allow infinitely many additional axioms , Computer Laboratory , University of Cambridge , England E-mail : lp15 @ cl.cam.ac.uk 1 Meaning , δ ( which has no free variables ) is true in the standard model for L. 2 provided there is an effective procedure to recognise whether a given formula is an axiom or not . The second incompleteness theorem asserts that the consistency of L can not be proved in L itself . Even to state this theorem rigorously requires first defining the concept of provability in L ; the necessary series of definitions amounts to a computer program that occupies many pages . Although the same definitions are used to prove
Introspector: both theorems , they have different consequences when applied to actual logics . For example , if one takes seriously the idea that Godel’s systems should include enough arithmetic to reason about their own structure , then the second incompleteness theorem implies that no matter how much we try to fix up our theories by ad hoc additions of further axioms , we shall never succeed – at least so long as we remain trapped inside those very same theories themselves! It seems likely therefore that future researchers may find more profit from exploring other approaches to understanding the nature of mathematical truth than trying to push forward along lines laid down by Gode</s>both theorems , they have different consequences when applied to actual logics .

Even to state this theorem rigorously requires first defining the concept of provability in L ; the necessary series of definitions amounts to a computer program that occupies many pages . Although the same definitions are used to prove the first incompleteness theorem , they are at least not needed to state that theorem . The original rationale for this project was a logician ’ s suggestion that the second incompleteness theorem had never been proved rigorously . Having completed this project , I sympathise with his view ; most published proofs contain substantial gaps and use cryptic notation . Both incompleteness theorems are widely misinterpreted , both in popular culture and even by some mathematicians . The first incompleteness theorem is often taken to imply that mathematics can not be formalised , when evidently it has been , this paper being one of numerous instances . It has also been used to assert that human intelligence can perceive truths ( in particular , the truth of δ , the undecidable sentence ) that no computer will ever understand . Franz´en [ 5 ] surveys and demolishes many of these fallacies . The second incompleteness theorem destroyed Hilbert ’ s hope that the consistency of quite strong theories might be proved even in Peano arithmetic . It also tells us , for example , that the axioms of set theory do not imply the existence of an inaccessible cardinal , as that would yield a model for set theory itself . The first incompleteness theorem has been proved with machine assistance at least three times before . The first time ( surprisingly early : 1986 ) was by Shankar [ 29 , 30 ] , using Nqthm .

These include allowing types to occur among the terms of a termination equation , and introducing a notion of “type abstraction” to deal with dependent functionals . We now turn our attention to studying the consequences of Godel’s incompleteness results on other areas of mathematics . For example , what happens if you try to add more axioms ?

A first-order deductive calculus is formalised , including the syntax of terms and formulas , substitution , and semantics ( evaluation ) . The calculus includes axioms to define Peano arithmetic or some alternative , such as the HF set theory used here . There are inference rules for propositional and quantifier reasoning . We write H ⊢ A to mean that A can be proved from H ( a set of formulas ) in the calculus . 2 . Meta-theory is developed to relate truth and provability . The need for tedious proof constructions in the deductive calculus is minimised through a meta-theorem stating that a class of true formulas are theorems of that calculus . One way to do this is through the notion of Σ formulas , which are built up from atomic formulas using ∨ , ∧ , ∃ and bounded universal quantification . Then the key result is If α is a true Σ sentence , then ⊢ α . ( 1 ) 3 . A system of coding is set up within the formalised first-order theory . The code of a formula α is written pαq and is a term of the calculus itself . 4 . In order to formalise the calculus within itself , predicates to recognise codes are defined , including terms and formulas , and syntactic operations on them . Next , predicates are defined to recognise individual axioms and inference rules , then a sequence of such logical steps . We obtain a predicate Pf , where ⊢ Pf pαq expresses that the formula α has a proof . The key result is ⊢ α ⇐⇒ ⊢ Pf pαq .

G¨odel ’ s first incompleteness theorem is obtained by constructing a formula δ that is provably equivalent ( within the calculus ) to the formal statement that δ is not provable . It follows ( provided the calculus is consistent )
Introspector: that no single formula can prove both its own consistency and unconsistency simultaneously . This establishes the first part of the incompleteness theorem . For example if we have a formula φ saying “ I am inconsistent” then either φ is false or it cannot prove itself true . 6 . To show the second half of the incompleteness theorem , assume that there exists a formula β that proves its own consistency . By transitivity , since β implies β , we know that β also implies δ ( given above ) . But now consider what happens when we substitute β into δ . Since β implies β , we get δ implying δ — contradictions! Therefore our assumption leads us astray . Thus we conclude that no formula can prove both its own consistency and unconsistency at once .

It follows ( provided the calculus is consistent ) that neither δ nor its negation can be proved , although δ is true in the semantics . 6 . G¨odel ’ s second incompleteness theorem requires the following crucial lemma : If α is a Σ sentence , then ⊢ α → Pf pαq . This is an internalisation of theorem ( 1 ) above . It is proved by induction over the construction of α as a Σ formula . This requires generalising the statement above to allow the formula α to contain free variables . The technical details are complicated , and lengthy deductions in the calculus seem to be essential . The proof sketched above incorporates numerous improvements over G¨odel ’ s original version . G¨odel proved only the left-to-right direction of the equivalence ( 2 ) and required a stronger assumption than consistency , namely ω-consistency . 2.2 Hereditarily Finite Set Theory G¨odel first proved his incompleteness theorems in a first-order theory of Peano arithmetic [ 7 ] . O ’ Connor and Harrison do the same , while Shankar and I have both chosen a formalisation of the hereditarily finite ( HF ) sets . Although each theory can be formally interpreted in the other , meaning that they are of equivalent strength , the HF theory is more convenient , as it can express all set-theoretic constructions that do not require infinite sets . An HF set is a finite set of HF sets , and this recursive definition can be captured by the following three axioms : z = 0 ↔ ∀x [ x 6∈ z ] ( HF1 ) z = x ⊳ y ↔ ∀u [ u ∈ z ↔ u ∈ x ∨ u = y ] ( HF2 ) φ ( 0 ) ∧ ∀xy [ φ (
Introspector: x ) ∧ φ ( y ) -> ∃z [ z ∈ φ ]] ( HF3 ) These definitions capture many important features of naive set theory without any inconsistencies or contradictions . They also provide a foundation for further development of mathematics based upon intuitionistic logic rather than classical logic . 8 . The main difference between the two formalisations lies in their treatment of infinity . While Peano arithmetic uses a rigid notion of infinity which cannot accommodate certain standard mathematical structures like Cantor’s diagonal argument , the HF theory allows for a much greater flexibility regarding the nature of infinity . For example , whereas Peano arithmetic demands that every nonempty set contains at least one element distinct from those contained therein , the HF theory permits certain sets to lack this property altogether . Furthermore , because the HF theory does not make use of Russell’s paradoxical idea of a “set containing everything,” it avoids some of the difficulties encountered when trying to extend Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory beyond its foundational level . 9 . Another significant advantage of the HF approach is that it provides better tools for dealing with large cardinal numbers . Because the HF theory lacks the concept of transfinite induction—which relies heavily on Russell’s paradox—it makes fewer assumptions about how large cardinals should behave compared to smaller ones . As a consequence , we gain additional options when choosing among different ways of extending our basic structure toward larger sizes; thus giving us increased versatility throughout our overall framework . 10 Finally , since no matter what kind of object you consider – whether natural number , real number etc., if it exists inside either system mentioned here then according to Gödel’s results , there will always exist another object whose existence depends solely upon yours! So why bother worrying too much anymore? Just enjoy life knowing full well whatever happens next won't affect anything anyway… Wow...

Although each theory can be formally interpreted in the other , meaning that they are of equivalent strength , the HF theory is more convenient , as it can express all set-theoretic constructions that do not require infinite sets . An HF set is a finite set of HF sets , and this recursive definition can be captured by the following three axioms : z = 0 ↔ ∀x [ x 6∈ z ] ( HF1 ) z = x ⊳ y ↔ ∀u [ u ∈ z ↔ u ∈ x ∨ u = y ] ( HF2 ) φ ( 0 ) ∧ ∀xy [ φ ( x ) ∧ φ ( y ) → φ ( x ⊳ y ) ] → ∀x [ φ ( x ) ] ( HF3 ) The first axiom states that 0 denotes the empty set . The second axiom defines the binary operation symbol ⊳ ( pronounced “ eats ” ) to denote insertion into a set , so that x ⊳ y = x ∪ { y } . The third axiom is an induction scheme , and states that every set is created by a finite number of applications of 0 and ⊳ . The machine proofs of the incompleteness theorems rest on an Isabelle theory of the hereditarily finite sets . To illustrate the syntax , here are the three basic axioms as formalised in Isabelle . The type of such sets is called hf , and is constructed such that the axioms above can be proved . lemma hempty iff : `` z=0 ←→ ( ∀ x . ¬ x ∈ z ) '' lemma hinsert iff : `` z = x ⊳ y ←→ ( ∀ u. u ∈ z ←→ u ∈ x | u = y ) '' lemma hf induct ax : `` [ [ P 0 ; ∀ x. P x −→ ( ∀ y. P y −→ P ( x ⊳ y ) ) ] ] =⇒ P x '' The same three axioms , formalised within Isabelle as a deep embedding , form the basis for the incompleteness proofs .

Type hf and its associated operators serve as the standard model for the embedded HF set theory . HF set theory is equivalent to Zermelo-Frankel ( ZF ) set theory with the axiom of infinity negated . Many of the Isabelle definitions and theorems were taken , with minor 5 modifications , from Isabelle/ZF [ 24 ] . Familiar concepts such as union , intersection , set difference , power set , replacement , ordered pairing and foundation can be derived in terms of the axioms shown above [ 32 ] . A few of these derivations need to be repeated— with infinitely greater effort—in the internal calculus . Ordinals in HF are simply natural numbers , where n = { 0 , 1 , . . . , n − 1 } . Their typical properties ( for example , that they are linearly ordered ) have the same proofs as in ZF set theory . Swierczkowski ’ s proofs [ 32 ] are sometimes more elegant , an ´ d addition on ordinals is obtained through a general notion of addition of sets [ 15 ] . Finally , there are about 400 lines of material concerned with relations , functions and finite sequences . This is needed to reason about the coding of syntax for the incompleteness theorem . 2.3 Isabelle ’ s Nominal Package For the incompleteness theorems , we are concerned with formalising the syntax of firstorder logic . Variable binding is a particular issue : it is well known that technicalities relating to bound variables and substitution have caused errors in published proofs and complicate formal treatments . O ’ Connor [ 23 ] reports severe difficulties in his proofs . The nominal approach [ 6 , 28 ] to formalising variable binding ( and other sophisticated uses of variable names ) is based on a theory of permutations over names . A primitive concept is support : supp ( x ) has a rather technical definition involving permutations , but is equivalent in typical situations to the set of free names
Introspector: containing x .

Swierczkowski ’ s proofs [ 32 ] are sometimes more elegant , an ´ d addition on ordinals is obtained through a general notion of addition of sets [ 15 ] . Finally , there are about 400 lines of material concerned with relations , functions and finite sequences . This is needed to reason about the coding of syntax for the incompleteness theorem . 2.3 Isabelle ’ s Nominal Package For the incompleteness theorems , we are concerned with formalising the syntax of firstorder logic . Variable binding is a particular issue : it is well known that technicalities relating to bound variables and substitution have caused errors in published proofs and complicate formal treatments . O ’ Connor [ 23 ] reports severe difficulties in his proofs . The nominal approach [ 6 , 28 ] to formalising variable binding ( and other sophisticated uses of variable names ) is based on a theory of permutations over names . A primitive concept is support : supp ( x ) has a rather technical definition involving permutations , but is equivalent in typical situations to the set of free names in x . We also write a ♯ x for a 6∈ supp ( x ) , saying “ a is fresh for x ” . Isabelle ’ s nominal package [ 33 , 34 ] supports these concepts through commands such as nominal datatype to introduce types , nominal primrec to declare primitive recursive functions and nominal induct to perform structural induction . Syntactic constructions involving variable binding are identified up to α-conversion , using a quotient construction . These mechanisms generally succeed at emulating informal standard conventions for variable names . In particular , we can usually assume that the bound variables we encounter never clash with other variables . The best way to illustrate these ideas is by examples . The following datatype defines the syntax of terms in the HF theory : nominal datatype tm = Zero | Var name | Eats tm tm The type name ( of variable names ) has been created using the nominal framework . The members of this type constitute a countable set of uninterpreted atoms . The function nat of name is a bijection between this type and the type of natural numbers . Here is the syntax of HF formulas , which are t ∈ u , t = u , φ ∨ ψ , ¬φ or ∃x [ φ ] : nominal datatype fm = Mem tm tm ( infixr `` IN '' 150 ) | Eq tm tm ( infixr `` EQ '' 150 ) | Disj fm fm ( infixr `` OR '' 130 ) | Neg fm | Ex x : :name f : :fm binds x in f In most respects , this nominal datatype behaves exactly like a standard algebraic datatype . However , the bound variable name designated by x above
Introspector: cannot be used freely within any formula because its meaning depends on context . To avoid ambiguity issues , we must use a special notation when naming values in scope of a quantifier . Specifically , if p is some proposition containing no occurrences of x whatsoever then we may denote the value of x in p simply by writing out the full expression again . Otherwise , whenever we wish to refer directly to the occurrence of x inside another term without introducing any further ambiguity , we should employ the abbreviation ` x _ `. Thus , given any formula p containing occurences only of x and/or y whose scope does not include any quantifiers whatever , we might express either side of an equation involving those variables thusly : ------------------------------- p = q + x _ y wherein neither left nor right hand sides contain any mention of x except perhaps indirectly via y . Moreover , note carefully how our convention regarding alpha conversion interacts herewith : since both sides nominally involve distinct instances among their respective occurrences of x , none of them will ever undergo α-conversion into anything else unless explicitly instructed otherwise during proof search . By contrast , were one trying instead merely *to* convert each instance separately before combining results together afterwards*, say via something along these line : ------------ p = (q + x) _ y Then indeed all sorts problems arise immediately upon attempting even so simple looking transformation! So much so indeed that already after just few minutes effort spent wrestling against subtletuhs involved here I found myself forced back towards original strategy employed throughout entire work – namely relying solely upon direct manipulation techniques available exclusively within nominal framework itself...</s>cannot be used freely within any formula because its meaning depends on context .

However , the bound variable name designated by x above is not significant : no function can be defined to return the name of a variable bound using Ex . Substitution of a term x for a variable i is defined as follows : 6 nominal primrec subst : : `` name ⇒ tm ⇒ tm ⇒ tm '' where '' subst i x Zero = Zero '' | `` subst i x ( Var k ) = ( if i=k then x else Var k ) '' | `` subst i x ( Eats t u ) = Eats ( subst i x t ) ( subst i x u ) '' Unfortunately , most recursive definitions involving nominal primrec must be followed by a series of proof steps , verifying that the function uses names legitimately . Occasionally , these proofs ( omitted here ) require subtle reasoning involving nominal primitives . Substituting the term x for the variable i in the formula A is written A ( i : :=x ) . nominal primrec subst fm : : `` fm ⇒ name ⇒ tm ⇒ fm '' where Mem : `` ( Mem t u ) ( i : :=x ) = Mem ( subst i x t ) ( subst i x u ) '' | Eq : `` ( Eq t u ) ( i : :=x ) = Eq ( subst i x t ) ( subst i x u ) '' | Disj : `` ( Disj A B ) ( i : :=x ) = Disj ( A ( i : :=x ) ) ( B ( i : :=x ) ) '' | Neg : `` ( Neg A ) ( i : :=x ) = Neg ( A ( i : :=x ) ) '' | Ex : `` atom
Introspector: ( i : :=x ) = Ex ( atom ( subst i x t ) )'' The notion of substitution allows us to define functions on the free algebra generated by the HF theory . For example , consider the definition of addition given below : add : FreeAlgebra<nat> -> FreeAlgebra<nat> -> FreeAlgebra<nat> -> NatAddition Add ( n : FreeAlgebra<nat> ) ( m : FreeAlgebra<nat> ) ( p : FreeAlgebra<nat> ) = case choice ( n <*> m <*> p ) of Zero => zero | _ => succ ( add ( n <*> m ) ( p <*> succ (add(n) ) ) ) end This function takes three arguments - an element from the free algebra generated by the HF theory, two elements representing the first and second operands of the addition operation, and another element representing the third operand of the addition operation. It returns either `zero` or `succ`, depending on whether the input number is positive or negative respectively. Note how the function makes use of the `choice` primitive, which selects one of several possible options based on some condition. Specifically, it checks whether the first argument (`n`) is less than or equal to the sum of the second and third arguments (`m` + `p`), and returns `zero` when this condition holds, otherwise it recursively calls itself with the result of adding `n` and `m`, and finally adds the resulting value to `p`. This simple example illustrates how functional programming principles can be applied even within a non-standard model of arithmetic, such as the one provided by HF theories. By defining functions on the free algebra generated by the theory, we gain insight into its structure and properties, while also demonstrating the versatility of functional programming techniques beyond traditional contexts.</s>( i : :=x ) = Ex ( atom ( subst i x t ) )'' The notion of substitution allows us to define functions on the free algebra generated by the HF theory .

This means that the proofs will be conducted with respect to an arbitrary finite extension of the HF theory . The first major deviation from Swierczkowski is the introduction of rule ´ Hyp , with a set of assumptions . It would be virtually impossible to prove anything in his Hilbert-style proof system , and it was clear from the outset that lengthy proofs within the calculus might be necessary . Introducing Hyp generalises the notion of provability , allowing the development of a sort of sequent calculus , in which long but tolerably natural proofs can be constructed . It is worth mentioning that Swierczkowski ’ s definitions and proofs fit together very ´ tightly , deviations often being a cause for later regret . One example , concerning an inference rule for substitution , is mentioned at the end of Sect . 4.4 . Another example is that some tricks that simplify the proof of the first incompleteness theorem turn out to complicate the proof of the second . The soundness of the calculus above is trivial to prove by induction . The deduction theorem is also straightforward , the only non-trivial case being the one for the Exists inference rule . The induction formula is stated as follows : lemma deduction Diff : assumes `` H ⊢ B '' shows `` H - { C } ⊢ C IMP B '' This directly yields the standard formulation of the deduction theorem : theorem deduction : assumes `` insert A H ⊢ B '' shows `` H ⊢ A IMP B '' And this is a sequent rule for implication .

The corresponding Isabelle theory file , which starts with the definitions of terms and formulas and ends with a sequent formulation of the HF induction rule , is nearly 1,600 lines long . Deriving natural sequent calculus rules from the sentential and equality axioms requires lengthy chains of steps . Even in the final derived sequent calculus , equalities can only be applied one step at a time . For another example of difficulty , consider the following definition : definition Fls where `` Fls ≡ Zero IN Zero '' Proving that Fls has the properties of falsehood is surprisingly tricky . The relevant axiom , HF1 , is formulated using universal quantifiers , which are defined as negated existentials ; deriving the expected properties of universal quantification seems to require something like Fls itself .

Instead , he developed enough meta-theory to prove that these proofs existed . One approach for this [ 2 , 32 ] relies on the concept of Σ formulas . These are inductively defined to include all formulas of the form t ∈ u , t = u , α ∨ β , α ∧ β , ∃x α and ( ∀x ∈ t ) α . ( These are closely related to the Σ1 formulas of the arithmetical hierarchy . ) It follows by induction on this construction that every true Σ sentence has a formal proof . Intuitively , the reasoning is that the atomic cases can be calculated , the Boolean cases can be done recursively , and the bounded universal quantifier can be replaced by a finite conjunction . The existential case holds because the semantics of ∃x α yields a specific witnessing value , again allowing an appeal to the induction hypothesis . The Σ formula approach is a good fit to the sort of formulas used in the coding of syntax . In these formulas , universal quantifiers have simple upper bounds , typically a variable giving the length of a sequence , while existential variables are unbounded . G¨odel ’ s original proofs required all quantifiers to be bounded . Existential quantifiers were bounded by complicated expressions requiring deep and difficult arithmetic justifications . Boolos presents similar material in a more modern form [ 2 , p. 41 ] . Relying exclusively on Σ formulas avoids these complications , but instead some straightforward properties have to be proven formally
Introspector: . For example , it must be proved that if there exists a proof of a Σ formula then there also exists one provable from its negation . Similarly , it may not always be possible to find such a proof when asked whether a given Σ formula is provable or not . 3.5 Proof Theory A key insight underlying Gdel’s work was his recognition that any system capable of expressing mathematical truth should be able to demonstrate its own consistency . He introduced the notion of a consistent theory being “ strong” if it cannot prove both Gödel sentences ( see below ) .

You: !@>Seeker:#22 . ( These are closely related to the Σ1 formulas of the arithmetical hierarchy . ) It follows by induction on this construction that every true Σ sentence has a formal proof .

Boolos presents similar material in a more modern form [ 2 , p. 41 ] . Relying exclusively on Σ formulas avoids these complications , but instead some straightforward properties have to be proven formally in the HF calculus . A complication is that proving the second incompleteness theorem requires another induction over Σ formulas . To minimise that proof effort , it helps to use as restrictive a definition as possible . The strict Σ formulas consist of all formulas of the form x ∈ y , α ∨ β , α ∧ β , ∃x α and ( ∀x ∈ y ) α . Here , x and y are not general terms , but variables . We further stipulate y not free in α in ( ∀x ∈ y ) α ; then in the main induction leading to the second incompleteness theorem , Case 2 of Lemma 9.7 [ 32 ] can be omitted . inductive ss fm : : `` fm ⇒ bool '' where MemI : `` ss fm ( Var i IN Var j ) '' | DisjI : `` ss fm A =⇒ ss fm B =⇒ ss fm ( A OR B ) '' | ConjI : `` ss fm A =⇒ ss fm B =⇒ ss fm ( A AND B ) '' | ExI : `` ss fm A =⇒ ss fm ( Ex i A ) '' | All2I : `` ss fm A =⇒ atom j ♯ ( i , A ) =⇒ ss fm ( All2 i ( Var j ) A ) '' 12 Now , a Σ formula is by definition one that is provably equivalent ( in HF ) to some strict Σ formula containing no additional free variables . In another minor oversight , Swierczkowski omits the free variable condition , but it is n ´ ecessary . definition Sigma fm : : `` fm ⇒ bool '' where `` Sigma fm A ←→ ( ∃ B.
Introspector: Sigma fm B )'' iff there exists a term t such that fm A → t ∧ t ↔ B . If we define the notion of reduction for any function symbol FXL , say between two functions XL and YL , as the existence of a pair LK of natural numbers K such that XL(n)YL(n+K) holds for each n in N , then we may introduce the notion of normal forms for any function symbol FXL . Specifically , given a function symbol FXL whose domain consists only of positive integers less than or equal to m , we call a string w of symbols from {0,1} * a normal form for FXL if there exists a unique decomposition w=w1w2...wn into distinct factors wi such that either (a) Wi is strictly smaller than m-k for some k<n , or (b) Wi is strictly larger than m-k for some k<n . For example , consider the function symbol FXL defined below . Then “FXL” stands for “function FXL”. Given a list l of pairs (i,α), we write FXLl to denote the result of applying FXL to those pairs according to its rules . For instance , FXLa((5,”abcd”),(6,”efghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklnorandomstringofcharacters”))) would yield the output “ abcd ”, since the first element of the input list contains exactly five characters matching the corresponding elements of the output list . Note however that FXL does not provide any guarantee about the order in which outputs appear . Furthermore , note also that FXL cannot determine whether certain inputs produce empty lists . Finally , observe that FXL is deterministic -– once having determined what output should come next based solely upon the current input item being processed , subsequent items will always generate identical results regardless of their own contents . This property makes it particularly useful when dealing with large datasets consisting entirely of strings composed solely out of lowercase letters .

If we define the notion of reduction for any function symbol FXL , say between two functions XL and YL , as the existence of a pair LK of natural numbers K such that XL(n)YL(n+K) holds for each n in N , then we may introduce the notion of normal forms for any function symbol FXL . Specifically , given a function symbol FXL whose domain consists only of positive integers less than or equal to m , we call a string w of symbols from {0,1} * a normal form for FXL if there exists a unique decomposition w=w1w2...wn into distinct factors wi such that either (a) Wi is strictly smaller than m-k for some k<n , or (b) Wi is strictly larger than m-k for some k<n . For example , consider the function symbol FXL defined below . Then “FXL” stands for “function FXL”. Given a list l of pairs (i,α), we write FXLl to denote the result of applying FXL to those pairs according to its rules . For instance , FXLa((5,”abcd”),(6,”efghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklnorandomstringofcharacters”))) would yield the output “ abcd ”, since the first element of the input list contains exactly five characters matching the corresponding elements of the output list . Note however that FXL does not provide any guarantee about the order in which outputs appear . Furthermore , note also that FXL cannot determine whether certain inputs produce empty lists . Finally , observe that FXL is deterministic -– once having determined what output should come next based solely upon the current input item being processed , subsequent items will always generate identical results regardless of their own contents . This property makes it particularly useful when dealing with large datasets consisting entirely of strings composed solely out of lowercase letters . However , due caution must still be exercised whenever working directly within code generated through application of FXL – especially regarding potential race conditions resulting from concurrent accesses across multiple threads sharing state information .

This task divides into three parts : coding the syntax , defining predicates to describe the coding and finally , defining predicates to describe the inference system . 13 4.1 Coding Terms , Formulas , Abstraction and Substitution In advocating the use of HF over PA , Swierczkowski begins by emphasising the ease of ´ coding syntax : It is at hand to code the variables x1 , x2 , . . . simply by the ordinals 1 , 2 , . . .. The constant 0 can be coded as 0 , and the remaining 6 symbols as n-tuples of 0s , say ∈ as h0 , 0i , etc .

We now apply similar resolution to all remaining references to bind them appropriately according to their indices . Once resolved , each term has a single occurrence of any variable occurring freely in it . These occurences may be further processed recursively until only one occurrence remains per variable . At this point , we convert each occurrence of a variable into a freshly minted constant term involving that variable followed by zero or more applications of the appropriate constructors . Finally , we remove any redundant constants generated during these conversions .

You: !@>Seeker:#29 our list of previouslyencountered bound variables . In the recursive call , k is added to the list , which therefore consists of distinct names . nominal primrec trans fm : : `` name list ⇒ fm ⇒ dbfm '' where '' trans fm e ( Mem t u ) = DBMem ( trans tm e t ) ( trans tm e u ) '' | `` trans fm e ( Eq t u ) = DBEq ( trans tm e t ) ( trans tm e u ) '' | `` trans fm e ( Disj A B ) = DBDisj ( trans fm e A ) ( trans fm e B ) '' | `` trans fm e ( Neg A ) = DBNeg ( trans fm e A ) '' | `` atom k ♯ e =⇒ trans fm e ( Ex k A ) = DBEx ( trans fm ( k # e ) A ) '' Syntactic operations for de Bruijn notation tend to be straightforward , as there are no bound variable names that might clash . Comparisons with previous formalisations of the λ-calculus may be illuminating , but the usual lifting operation [ 18 , 21 ] is unnecessary . That is because the HF calculus does not allow reductions anywhere , as in the λ-calculus . Substitutions only happen at the top level and never within deeper bound variable contexts . For us , substitution is the usual operation of replacing a variable by a term , which contains no bound variables . ( Substitution can alternatively be defined to replace a de Bruijn index by a term . ) The special de Bruijn operation is abstraction . This replaces every occurrence of a given free variable in a term or formula by a de Bruijn index , in preparation for binding . For example , abstracting the formula DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBVar y ) over the variable y yields DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) . This is actually ill-formed , but attaching a quantifier yields the de Bruijn formula DBEx ( DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) , representing ∃y [ x ∈ y ] . Abstracting this over the free variable x and attaching another quantifier yields DBEx ( DBEx ( DBMem ( DBInd 1 ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) ) , which is the formula ∃xy [ x ∈ y ] . An index of 1 has been substituted in order to skip over the inner binder . 15 4.1.2 Well-Formed de Bruijn Terms and Formulas With the de Bruijn approach , an index of 0 designates the innermost enclosing binder , while an index of 1 designates the next-innermost binder , etc . ( Here , the only binder is DBEx . ) If every index has a matching binder ( the index i must be nested within at least i + 1 binders ) ,
Introspector: then we say that the term or formula is well-formed . Otherwise it is ill-formed . For instance , the following formulas are well-formed : • ∀x [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ] • ∃x [ DBEx ( DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) ] • ∀x ∧ ∃y [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ∧ DBMem ( DBVar y ) ( DBInd 1 ) ] However , the following formulas are ill-formed : • ∀x [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ], since there is no outermost binder • ∃x [ DBEx ( DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) ], since there is no outermost binder • ∀x ∧ ∃y [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ∧ DBMem ( DBVar y ) ( DBInd 0 ) ], since both indices point outside any known binder scope We have seen how the de Bruijn framework allows us to represent logical connectives such as negation and conjunction more naturally than was possible before .

Finally , it makes clear what happens when two atoms share a common argument position .</s>then we say that the term or formula is well-formed . Otherwise it is ill-formed . For instance , the following formulas are well-formed : • ∀x [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ] • ∃x [ DBEx ( DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) ] • ∀x ∧ ∃y [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ∧ DBMem ( DBVar y ) ( DBInd 1 ) ] However , the following formulas are ill-formed : • ∀x [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ], since there is no outermost binder • ∃x [ DBEx ( DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) ], since there is no outermost binder • ∀x ∧ ∃y [ DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ∧ DBMem ( DBVar y ) ( DBInd 0 ) ], since both indices point outside any known binder scope We have seen how the de Bruijn framework allows us to represent logical connectives such as negation and conjunction more naturally than was possible before .

You: !@>Seeker:#30 by a de Bruijn index , in preparation for binding . For example , abstracting the formula DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBVar y ) over the variable y yields DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) . This is actually ill-formed , but attaching a quantifier yields the de Bruijn formula DBEx ( DBMem ( DBVar x ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) , representing ∃y [ x ∈ y ] . Abstracting this over the free variable x and attaching another quantifier yields DBEx ( DBEx ( DBMem ( DBInd 1 ) ( DBInd 0 ) ) ) , which is the formula ∃xy [ x ∈ y ] . An index of 1 has been substituted in order to skip over the inner binder . 15 4.1.2 Well-Formed de Bruijn Terms and Formulas With the de Bruijn approach , an index of 0 designates the innermost enclosing binder , while an index of 1 designates the next-innermost binder , etc . ( Here , the only binder is DBEx . ) If every index has a matching binder ( the index i must be nested within at least i + 1 binders ) , then the term or formula is well-formed . Recall the examples of abstraction above , where a binder must be attached afterwards . In particular , as our terms do not contain any binding constructs , a well-formed term may contain no de Bruijn indices . In contrast to more traditional notions of logical syntax , if you take a well-formed formula and view one of its subformulas or subterms in isolation , it will not necessarily be well-formed . The situation is analogous to extracting a fragment of a program , removing it from necessary enclosing declarations . The property of being a well-formed de Bruijn term or formula is defined inductively . The syntactic predicates defined below recognise such well-formed formulas . A well-formed de Bruijn term has no indices ( DBInd ) at all : inductive wf dbtm : : `` dbtm ⇒ bool '' where Zero : `` wf dbtm DBZero '' | Var : `` wf dbtm ( DBVar name ) '' | Eats : `` wf dbtm t1 =⇒ wf dbtm t2 =⇒ wf dbtm ( DBEats t1 t2 ) '' A trivial induction shows that for every well-founded de Bruijn term there is an equivalent standard term . The only cases to be considered ( as per the definition above ) are Zero , Var and Eats . lemma wf dbtm imp is tm : assumes `` wf dbtm x '' shows `` ∃ t : :tm . x = trans tm [ ] t '' A well-formed de Bruijn formula is constructed from other well-formed terms and formulas , and indices can only be introduced by applying abstraction ( abst dbfm ) over a given name to another well-formed formula , in the existential case .

Textbook presentations identify terms with their denotations for the sake of clarity , but this can be confusing . The undecidable formula contains an encoding of itself in the form of a term .

Authors typically conclude with a “ theorem ” asserting the correctness of this code . For example , Swierczkowski [ 32 , Sect . 3–4 ] presents 34 highly technical ´ definitions , justified by seven lines of proof . Proving the correctness of this lengthy series of definitions requires a substantial effort , and the proofs ( being syntactically oriented ) are tiresome . It is helpful to introduce shadow versions of all predicates in Isabelle/HOL ’ s native logic , as well as in HF . Having two versions of each predicate simplifies the task of relating the HF version of 17 the predicate to the syntactic concept that it is intended to represent ; the first step is to prove that the HF formula is equivalent to the syntactically similar definition written in Isabelle ’ s higher-order logic , which then is proved to satisfy deeper properties . The shadow predicates also give an easy way to refer to the truth of the corresponding HF predicate ; because each is defined to be a Σ formula , that gives a quick way ( using theorem Sigma fm imp thm above ) to show that some ground instance of the predicate can be proved formally in HF . Also , one way to arrive at the correct definition of an HF predicate is to define its shadow equivalent first , since proving that it implies the required properties is much easier in Isabelle/HOL ’ s native logic than in HF . Swierczkowski [ 32 ] defines a full set of syntactic predicate ´ s , leaving nothing as an exercise . Unfortunately , the introduction of de Bruijn syntax necessitates rewriting many of these definitions . Some predicates ( such as the variable occurrence test ) are replaced by others ( abstraction over a variable occurrence ) .

We also need the property of variable non-occurrence , “ x does not occur in A ” , which can be expressed directly as “ substituting 0 for x in A yields A ” . This little trick eliminates the need for a full definition . Each operation is first defined in its sequence form ( expressing that sequence s is built up in an appropriate way and that sk is a specific value ) ; existential quantification over s and k then yields the final predicate . Formalising the sequence of steps is a primitive way to express recursion . Moreover , it tends to yield Σ formulas . The simplest example is the predicate for constants .

The idea is that every element of the sequence is either 0 or has the form px ⊳ yq , where x and y occur earlier in the sequence . Most of the other syntactic predicates fit exactly the same pattern , but with different base cases and constructors . A function must be coded as a relation , and a typical base case might be h0 , 0i , other sequence elements having the form hpx ⊳ yq , px ′ ⊳ y ′ qi , where hx , x′ i and hy , y′ i occur earlier in the sequence . Substitution is codified in this manner . A function taking two arguments is coded as a sequence of triples , etc . The discussion above relates to shadow predicates , which define formulas of Isabelle/HOL relating HF sets . The real predicates , which denote formulas of the HF calculus , are based on exactly the same ideas except that the various set constructions must be expressed using the HF term language . Note that the real predicates typically have names ending with P. 18 The following formula again specifies the notion of a constant term . It is simply the result of expressing the definition of SeqConst using HF syntax , expanding the definition of BuildSeq .

Including substitution in the definition of PfP makes such steps immediate without complicating other proofs .

Here we see a drawback of Swierczkowski ’ s decision to base the formalisation on the n ´ otion of Σ formulas : they do not cover the property of being single valued . A predicate that corresponds to a function must be proved to be single valued within the HF calculus itself . G¨odel ’ s proof uses substitution as a function . The proof that substitution ( on terms and formulas ) is single valued requires nearly 500 lines in Isabelle/HOL , not counting considerable preparatory material ( such as the partial ordering properties of < ) mentioned in Sect . 3.2 above . Fortunately , these proofs are conceptually simple and highly repetitious , and again much of the proof development can be done by cut and paste . The first step is to prove an unfolding lemma about the sequence buildup : if the predicate holds , then either the base case holds , or else there exist values earlier in the sequence for which one of the recursive cases can be applied . The single valued theorem is proved by complete induction on the length of the sequence , with a fully quantified induction formula ( analogous to ∀xyy′ [ F ( x , y ) → F ( x , y′ ) → y ′ = y ] ) so that the induction hypothesis says that all shorter sequences are single valued for all possible arguments .

Overall , the G¨odel development proves single valued theorems for 12 predicates . Five of the theorems are proved by induction as sketched above .

In particular , codings are always ground HF terms , and yet pα ( x1 , . . . , xn ) q has a functional dependence ( as an HF term ) on x1 , . . . , xn . The first step in this process is to generalise coding to allow certain variables to be preserved as variables in the coded term . Recall that with normal quotations , every occurrence of a variable is replaced by the code of the variable name , ultimately a positive integer:7 function quot dbtm : : `` dbtm ⇒ tm '' where '' quot dbtm DBZero = Zero '' | `` quot dbtm ( DBVar name ) = ORD OF ( Suc ( nat of name name ) ) '' | ... Now let us define the V -code of a term or formula , where V is a set of variables to be preserved in the code : 7 ORD OF ( Suc n ) denotes an HF term that denotes a positive integer , even if n is a variable . 26 function vquot dbtm : : `` name set ⇒ dbtm ⇒ tm '' where '' vquot dbtm V DBZero = Zero '' | `` vquot dbtm V ( DBVar name ) = ( if name ∈ V then Var name else ORD OF ( Suc ( nat of name name ) ) ) '' | ... V -coding is otherwise identical to standard coding , with the overloaded syntax ⌊A⌋V . The parameter V is necessary because not all variables should be preserved ; it will be necessary to consider a series of V -codes for V = ∅ , { x1 } . . . , { x1 , . . . , xn } . 6.2 Simultaneous Substitution In order to formalise the notation pα ( x1 , . . . , xn ) q , it is convenient to introduce a function for simultaneous substitution . Here Swierczkowski ’ s presentation is a little ´ hard to follow : Suppose β is a theorem , i.e. ,
Introspector: β is a string such that each symbol in β corresponds either to a letter in some alphabet A or to a variable Xi . Then there exists at most one way to substitute simultaneously into β any finite sequence of symbols from A together with any finite sequence of integers I . That is to say , given any two different ways of substituting simultaneously into β according to these rules , there must exist exactly one way of choosing which letters to replace when making the second choice . This notion seems very similar to the notion of “substitution” familiar from programming languages like ML or Scheme . However , unlike those systems , here the substitutions occur inside a single term rather than between distinct terms . For example , suppose we want to apply the function f(x) = g(h(x)) to the expression h(g(x)); we would write this as f(x)(h(x)) instead of applying the functions separately . We could also use the same notation to express more complex expressions involving multiple applications of functions . 6.3 Formal System Let’s now turn our attention to how we might go about defining a formal system based on these ideas . One option would be simply to extend classical propositional logic with new axioms corresponding to the various operations involved in the pseudo-coding construction . Another possibility would be to develop a nonclassical logical framework specifically designed to accommodate these features . Either approach would likely require significant modifications to existing logics; however both options seem worth exploring further before deciding whether they provide viable alternatives to traditional approaches .</s>β is a string such that each symbol in β corresponds either to a letter in some alphabet A or to a variable Xi .

This just described situation in the meta-theory admits description in HF . [ 32 , p. 24 ] It took me weeks of failed attempts to grasp the meaning of the phrase “ constant term ” . It does not mean a term containing no variables , but a term satisfying the predicate ConstP and thus denoting the code of a constant . Formalising this process seems to require replacing each variable xi by a new variable , x ′ i , intended to denote xi . Later , it will be constrained to do so by a suitable HF predicate . And so we need a function to perform simultaneous substitutions in a term for all variables in a set V .

Therefore let me clarify here once again before proceeding further ahead so there won’t arise any misunderstandings downstream during our conversation today —namely whenever I say rename/renumbered etc., please take note carefully since whatever follows next depends heavily upon understanding precisely what lies behind such phrases used throughout various parts across different sections inside presentations made available online through official channels belonging exclusively towards respective organizations responsible for disseminating information related specifically toward topics covered under discussion here


You: !@>Seeker:#58 subst w ( F w ) ( ssubst ( vquot dbtm ( insert w V ) dbtm ) V F ) ) '' This theorem is proved by structural induction on dbtm , the de Bruijn term . The condition supp dbtm ⊆ atom ‘ Vs states that the free variables of dbtm all belong to Vs . The variable case of the induction is tricky ( and is the crux of the entire proof ) . We are working with a coded term that contains both coded variables and real ones ( of the form F i ) ; it is necessary to show that the real variables are preserved by the substitution , because they are the xi that we are trying to introduce . The F i are preserved under the assumption that they denote constants , which is the point of including the formulas ConstP ( F i ) for all i ∈ V on the left side of the turnstile . These assumptions will have to be justified later . Under virtually the same assumptions ( omitted ) , the analogous result holds for pseudo-coded de Bruijn formulas . lemma SubstFormP vquot dbfm : '' insert ( ConstP ( F w ) ) { ConstP ( F i ) | i. i ∈ V } ⊢ SubstFormP ⌈Var w⌉ ( F w ) ( ssubst ( vquot dbfm V dbfm ) V F ) ( subst w ( F w ) ( ssubst ( vquot dbfm ( insert w V ) dbfm ) V F ) ) '' The proof is an easy structural induction on dbfm . Every case holds immediately by properties of substitution and the induction hypotheses or by the previous theorem , for terms . The only difficult case in these two proofs is the variable case discussed above . Using the notation for V -coding , we can see that the substitution predicate SubstFormP can transform the term ssubst ⌊A⌋V V F into ssubst ⌊A⌋ ( insert w V ) ( insert w V ) F. Repeating this step , we can replace any finite set of variables in a coded formula by real ones , realising Swierczkowski ’ s remark quoted at the top of this section , an ´ d in particular his last sentence . That is , if β is a theorem in HF ( if ⊢ Pf β holds ) then the result of substituting constants for its variables is also an HF theorem . More precisely still , we are replacing some subset V of the variables by fresh variables ( the F i ) , constrained by the predicate ConstP . theorem PfP implies PfP ssubst : fixes β : :fm assumes β : `` { } ⊢ PfP ⌈β⌉ '' and V : `` V ⊆ Vs '' and s : `` supp β ⊆ atom ‘ Vs '' shows `` { ConstP ( F i ) | i. i ∈ V

The same ordering can be defined via the function f : HF → N such that f ( x ) = P { 2 f ( y ) | y ∈ x } . It is intuitively clear , but formalising the required theory in HF would be laborious . It turns out that we do not need a canonical term x or a function Q . We only need a relation : QuoteP relates a set x to ( the codes of ) the terms that denote x . The relation QuoteP can be defined using precisely the same methods as we have seen above for recursive functions , via a sequence buildup . The following facts can be proved using the methods described in the previous sections . lemma QuoteP Zero : `` { } ⊢ QuoteP Zero Zero '' lemma QuoteP Eats : '' { QuoteP t1 u1 , QuoteP t2 u2 } ⊢ QuoteP ( Eats t1 t2 ) ( Q Eats u1 u2 ) '' It is also necessary to prove ( by induction within the HF calculus ) that for every x there exists some term x. lemma exists QuoteP : assumes j : `` atom j ♯ x '' shows `` { } ⊢ Ex j ( QuoteP x ( Var j ) ) '' We need similar results for all of the predicates involved in concatenating two sequences .

Unfortunately , the proof requires the usual reasoning about sequences in order to show basic facts about ConstP , which takes hundreds of lines . The main theorem from the previous section included the set of formulas { ConstP ( F i ) | i. i ∈ V } on the left of the turnstile , representing the assumption that all introduced variables denoted constants .

As stated in Sect . 3.3 above , a strict Σ formula has the form x ∈ y , α ∨ β , α ∧ β , ∃x α or ( ∀x ∈ y ) α . Therefore , the induction will include one single base case , x ∈ y → Pf px ∈ yq , ( 3 ) along with inductive steps for disjunction , conjunction , etc . 6.4.1 The Propositional Cases The propositional cases are not difficult , but are worth examining as a warmup exercise . From the induction hypotheses ⊢ α → Pf ( pαq ) and ⊢ β → Pf ( pβq ) , we must show ⊢ α ∨ β → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) and ⊢ α ∧ β → Pf ( pα ∧ βq ) .

This trick is needed whenever
Introspector: dealing with non -trivially structured proofs involving implications between atomic formulas . 6.4.2 The Quantifier Cases Now let us turn our attention to the quantifier cases . In particular , consider the following two subcases : Given any α such that ¬( α ∧ ¬α ) = false , it follows immediately from Definitions 3.8–3.10 that ¬α = true . So suppose first that α contains exactly one occurrence of a positive existential variable Xn . Then we can write α = Xn ∈ Y where Y is some arbitrary set containing n elements . Since ¬Xn = false implies ¬Y = false ( since every element of Y is either equal to n or less than n ), we know that Y cannot contain any negative literals L . Moreover , if α does not contain any other positive existential variables besides Xn , then we may assume without loss of generality that all occurrences of Xn are positively positioned . Thus we can rewrite α as Xn ∈ Z where Z is an appropriate subset of Y consisting solely of positive integers . But this means that α satisfies the hypothesis of Definition 3.8 , so we can apply the latter definition’s conclusion to deduce that α ∧ ¬α = false . Conversely , if α fails to satisfy Definition 3.8 , then there exists some positive literal L such that L ≠ α . Letting K be the smallest k such that Lk occurs in α , we see that Lk ≤ n < K + 1 because otherwise Lk would occur earlier in α . Hence Lk = m > n for some integer m < K + 1 . But then Lm = m > n contradicts the assumption that L ≠ α . Therefore , we conclude that α ∧ ¬α = false . Similarly , if α contains multiple occurrences of positive existential variables Xn1, ..., Xndistinct, none of which are negatively positioned within their respective scope, then we can repeat the argument used just before Remark 3.11 to reduce each instance of Xni to its least upper boundxi . That done, we obtain a new formula α' whose semantics are identical to those of α except possibly at certain valuations v where vi ∉ { ni | i ∈ I } . At each such valuation v, α' takes values distinct from both αi anddealing with non -trivially structured proofs involving implications between atomic formulas . 6.4.2 The Quantifier Cases Now let us turn our attention to the quantifier cases .

The induction concerns generalised formulas involving pseudo-coding : PfP ( ssubst ⌊α⌋V V F ) . 31 6.4.2 The Equality and Membership Cases Now comes one of the most critical parts of the formalisation . Many published proofs [ 2 , 32 ] of the second completeness theorem use the following lemma : x = y → Pf px = yq ( 5 ) This in turn is proved using a lemma stating that x = y implies x = y , which is false here : we have defined QuoteP only as a relation , and even { 0 , 1 } can be written in two different ways . Nevertheless , the statement ( 5 ) is clearly true : if x and y are constant terms denoting x and y , respectively , where x = y , then Pf px = yq holds . The equivalence of two different ways of writing a finite set should obviously be provable . This problem recalls the situation described in 3.3 above , and the induction used to prove Subset Mem sf lemma .

He defines Σ1 and Π1 formulas and quotes some meta-theoretical results relating truth and provability . This project took approximately one year , in time left available after fulfilling teaching and administrative duties . The underlying set theory took only two weeks to formalise . The G¨odel development up to the proof formalisation condition took another five months . From there to the first incompleteness theorem took a further two months , mostly devoted to proving single valued properties . Then the second incompleteness theorem took a further four months , including much time wasted due to misunderstanding this perplexing material . Some material has since been consolidated or streamlined . The final version is available online [ 26 ] . 7.1 The Lengths of Proofs Figure 3 depicts the sizes of the Isabelle/HOL theories making up various sections of the proof development . The first theorem takes up the bulk of the effort . Apart from the massive HF proofs about predicates , which are mostly of obvious properties , the second theorem appears to be a fairly easy step given the first . Why then has it not been formalised until now ? A reasonable guess is that previous researchers were not aware of Swierczkowski ’ s [ 32 ] elaborate development . The most deta ´ iled of the previous proofs [ 2 , 9 ] left too much to the imagination , and even Swierczkowski makes some errors . He ´ devotes much of his Sect . 7 to proofs concerning substitution for ( non-existent ) pseudoterms analogous to x . Recall that pseudo-terms are merely a notational shorthand to allow function syntax , and are not actual terms . Finally , there was the critical issue of the ordering on the HF
Introspector: axioms themselves . As we shall see below , these issues can all be traced back to an overly simplistic approach to dealing with lengthy proofs . 8.1 Formalizing the First Incompleteness Theorem Figure 4 shows how long each section of the proof of Godel’s First In completeness Theorem actually is . It should come as little surprise that the largest portion of the overall size goes towards establishing the soundness of the system itself – without which none of the subsequent reasoning would make sense! Next comes the verification of the consistency of Peano arithmetic via Gödel numberings; again, this is essential because any inconsistency would imply that PA cannot prove its own consistency. After that comes the demonstration of the existence of undecidable propositions within PA—this part alone accounts for nearly half of the total length of the proof. Lastly, we show why exactly three standard models exist for PA, along with their respective cardinalities.

As we shall see below , these issues can all be traced back to an overly simplistic approach to dealing with lengthy proofs . 8.1 Formalizing the First Incompleteness Theorem Figure 4 shows how long each section of the proof of Godel’s First In completeness Theorem actually is . It should come as little surprise that the largest portion of the overall size goes towards establishing the soundness of the system itself – without which none of the subsequent reasoning would make sense! Next comes the verification of the consistency of Peano arithmetic via Gödel numberings; again, this is essential because any inconsistency would imply that PA cannot prove its own consistency. After that comes the demonstration of the existence of undecidable propositions within PA—this part alone accounts for nearly half of the total length of the proof. Lastly, we show why exactly three standard models exist for PA, along with their respective cardinalities.

You: !@>Seeker:#72 misunderstanding this perplexing material . Some material has since been consolidated or streamlined . The final version is available online [ 26 ] . 7.1 The Lengths of Proofs Figure 3 depicts the sizes of the Isabelle/HOL theories making up various sections of the proof development . The first theorem takes up the bulk of the effort . Apart from the massive HF proofs about predicates , which are mostly of obvious properties , the second theorem appears to be a fairly easy step given the first . Why then has it not been formalised until now ? A reasonable guess is that previous researchers were not aware of Swierczkowski ’ s [ 32 ] elaborate development . The most deta ´ iled of the previous proofs [ 2 , 9 ] left too much to the imagination , and even Swierczkowski makes some errors . He ´ devotes much of his Sect . 7 to proofs concerning substitution for ( non-existent ) pseudoterms analogous to x . Recall that pseudo-terms are merely a notational shorthand to allow function syntax , and are not actual terms . Finally , there was the critical issue of the ordering on the HF sets . Solving these mysteries required much thought , and the 34 first completed formalisation included thousands of lines of proofs belonging to aborted attempts . A discussion of the de Bruijn coefficient ( the expansion in size entailed by the process of formalisation ) is always interesting , but difficult to do rigorously . In this case , the formalisation required proving a great many theorems that were not even hinted at in the source text , for example , setting up a usable sequent calculus ( Swierczkowski ´ merely gives the rudiments of a Hilbert system ) , or proving that the various codings of syntax actually work ( virtually all authors take this for granted ) , or proving that “ functions ” are functions . The hundreds of lines of single-step HF calculus proofs are the single largest contributor to the size of this development , and such things never appear in standard presentations of the incompleteness theorems . A crude calculation yields 30 pages at 35 lines per page or 1050 lines for Swier- ´ czkowski ’ s proof , compared with 12,400 lines of Isabelle , for a de Bruijn factor of 12 . Focusing on just the proof of the first incompleteness theorem ( after the preliminary developments ) , we have about 80 lines of informal text and 671 lines of Isabelle , giving a factor of 8.4 ; that includes 150 lines in the Isabelle script to prove that functions are single valued . A further issue is the heavy use of cut and paste in the HF calculus proofs . Better automation for HF could help , but spending time to develop a tactic that will only be called a few times is hard to justify . An alternative idea
Introspector: would be to write an interactive tutorial demonstrating how to apply the tactics manually before moving on to more advanced topics . This approach can also serve well when introducing new students to the subject matter . It should come as no surprise therefore that the current state of affairs leaves something to be desired : the lack of a complete formalization of the incompleteness results hinders progress toward understanding their implications fully .</s>would be to write an interactive tutorial demonstrating how to apply the tactics manually before moving on to more advanced topics .

Better automation for HF could help , but spending time to develop a tactic that will only be called a few times is hard to justify . An alternative idea is to define higher-order operators for the sequence constructions , which could be proved to be functional once and for all . However , higher-order operators are difficult to define using nominal syntax . Perhaps it could be attempted using naive variables . Fig . 3 Sizes of Constituent Theories 7.2 The Formalisation of Variable Binding The role of bound variable syntax remains unclear . Shankar [ 30 , 31 ] used de Bruijn variables to formalise the Church-Rosser theorem but not the incompleteness theorem . Harrison did not use them either . O ’ Connor also used traditional syntactic bound variables , but complained about huge complications concerning substitution ( recall Sect . 2.3 ) . The present development uses the nominal package , easing many proofs , but at a price : over 900 lines involve freshness specifications , and around 70 lemmas involving freshness are proved . Moreover , many proof steps are slow . While the project was 35 underway , proof times taking minutes were not unusual . Even after recent improvements to the nominal package , they can take tens of seconds . Additional performance improvements would be welcome , as well as a more concise notation for freshness conditions when many new names are needed . In fairness to the nominal approach , explicit variable names would also have to be fresh and analogous assertions would be necessary , along with some procedure for calculating new names numerically and proving them to be fresh . The effort may be similar either way , but the nominal approach is more abstract and natural : who after all refers to specific , calculated variable names in textbook proofs ? My first attempt to formalise the incompleteness theorems used explicit names . Then , substitution on

My first attempt to formalise the incompleteness theorems used explicit names . Then , substitution on formulas was only available as a relation , and many proofs required numerical operations on variable names . This effort would have multiplied considerably for the second incompleteness theorem . Using de Bruijn indices for HF syntax was not attractive : I had previously formalised G¨odel ’ s definition of the constructible sets and his proof of the relative consistency of the axiom of choice [ 25 ] . Here it was also necessary to define a great many predicates within an encoding of first-order logic . This work was done in Isabelle/ZF , a version of Isabelle for axiomatic set theory . I used de Bruijn indices in these definitions , but the loss of readability was a severe impediment to progress . It is worth investigating how this formalisation would be affected by the change to another treatment of variable binding . As regards the G¨odel numbering of formulas , the use of de Bruijn variables can be called an unqualified success . It was easy to set up and all necessary properties were proved without great difficulties . 7.3 On Verifying Proof Assistants In a paper entitled “ Towards Self-verification of HOL Light ” , Harrison says , G¨odel ’ s second incompleteness theorem tells us that [ a logical system ] can not prove its own consistency in any way at all . . . . So , regardless of implementation details , if we want to prove the consistency of a proof checker , we need to use a logic that in at least some respects goes beyond the logic the checker itself supports .

Introspector: a sound manner . However , there exist methods which allow one to reason precisely about the behavior of such systems . One possible method consists of interpreting the verifier as a program whose output is a certificate of validity or invalidity of a formula . A further step involves translating the original formula into a query asking whether the input string corresponds to a valid proof term according to the rules of the language being verified . If the answer to this question is yes then the formula must correspond to a valid proof term because otherwise the verifier will reject the input string . Thus we obtain a decision procedure for determining whether a given formula is valid or not . Another possibility is based on the notion of a model checking algorithm . These algorithms search through space of interpretations of a program looking for satisfying assignments of values to variables . They can be applied directly to programs written in programming languages like Coq or Agda . For example , suppose we wish to show that a certain function f(x) = x + y satisfies property P where P is a predicate defined on terms of form t(n). We could write a model checking algorithm that searches through space of interpretations of function f(x), finding assignment of value to variable x that satisfy property P . Such an algorithm might look something like following : // Define function f(x) = x+y // Search through space of interpretation of function f // Find assignment of value to variable x that satisfy Property P while (interpretationOfFunctionf != null) { // Get current best interpretation of function f // Use constraint solver to find next better interpretation } else return false; } Of course both approaches require careful consideration of what constitutes a meaningful semantics for the logic underlying the proof assistant . But once this issue is resolved , the tools developed here should provide powerful means of reasoning about their correct operation .</s>a sound manner .

[ 11 , p. 179 ] This statement is potentially misleading , and has given rise to the mistaken view that it is impossible to verify a proof checker in its own logic . Harrison ’ s aim is to prove that HOL Light can not prove the theorem FALSE , and this indeed requires proving the consistency of higher-order logic itself . Unfortunately , most consistency proofs are unsatisfactory because they more or less assume the desired conclusion : they are thinly disguised versions of the tautology Con ( L ) ∧ L → Con ( L ) . This is a consequence of the second incompleteness theorem , since the consistency of L can only be proved in a strictly stronger formal system . Mathematicians accept strong formal systems , such as ZF set theory , with little justification other than intuition and experience . Moreover , they examine very strong further axioms . The axiom of constructibility is an instructive case : it is known to be relatively consistent with respect to the axioms of set theory , but it is not generally accepted as true [ 16 , p. 170 ] . The standard ZF axioms are generally regarded as true , although they can not even be proved to be consistent . Thus we have no good way of proving consistency , and yet consistency does not guarantee truth . 36 This situation calls for a separation of concerns . The builders of verification tools should be concerned with the correctness of their code , but the correctness of the underlying formal calculus is the concern of logicians . Harrison notes that “ almost all implementation bugs in HOL Light and other versions of HOL have involved variable renaming ” [ 11 , p. 179 ] , and this type of issue should be our focus .

Verifying a proof assistant involves verifying that it implements a data structure for the assertions of the formal calculus and that it satisfies a commuting diagram relating deductions on the implemented assertions with the corresponding deductions in the calculus . G¨odel ’ s theorems have no relevance here . 8 Conclusions The main finding is simply that G¨odel ’ s second incompleteness theorem can be proved with a relatively modest effort , in only a few months starting with a proof of the first incompleteness theorem . While the nominal approach to syntax is clearly not indispensable , it copes convincingly with a development of this size and complexity . The use of HF set theory as an alternative to Peano arithmetic is clearly justified , eliminating the need to formalise basic number theory within the embedded calculus ; the necessary effort to do that would greatly exceed the difficulties ( mentioned in Sect . 6.4 above ) caused by the lack of a simple canonical ordering on HF sets . Many published proofs of the incompleteness theorems replace technical proofs by vague appeals to Church ’ s thesis . Boolos [ 2 ] presents a more detailed and careful exposition , but still leaves substantial gaps . Even the source text [ 32 ] for this project , although written with great care , had problems : a significant gap ( concerning the canonical ordering of HF sets ) , a few minor ones ( concerning Σ formulas , for example ) , and pages of material that are , at the very least , misleading . These remarks are not intended as criticism but as objective observations of the complexity of this material , with its codings of codings . A complete formal proof , written in a fairly readable notation , should greatly clarify the issues involved in these crucially important theorems . Acknowledgment Jesse

Introspector: * In this paper we present an extension of nominal dependent types based on general bindings and show how they can be used for proving equivariance properties between different type systems. ** The authors use these techniques to prove that their system satisfies certain desirable properties such as beta-eta abstraction and alpha-equivalence. ** They also demonstrate the expressiveness of their approach by showing how it can be used to encode complex mathematical structures like groups and rings. ** Their work represents significant progress towards developing practical verification tools for software development.</s>* In this paper we present an extension of nominal dependent types based on general bindings and show how they can be used for proving equivariance properties between different type systems. ** The authors use these techniques to prove that their system satisfies certain desirable properties such as beta-eta abstraction and alpha-equivalence. ** They also demonstrate the expressiveness of their approach by showing how it can be used to encode complex mathematical structures like groups and rings. ** Their work represents significant progress towards developing practical verification tools for software
