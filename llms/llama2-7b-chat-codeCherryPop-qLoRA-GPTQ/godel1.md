You: !@>Seeker:#0 A Mechanised Proof of G¨odel ’ s Incompleteness Theorems using Nominal Isabelle Lawrence C. Paulson Abstract An Isabelle/HOL formalisation of G¨odel ’ s two incompleteness theorems is presented . The work follows Swierczkowski ’ s detailed proof of the theorems using hered ´ - itarily finite ( HF ) set theory [ 32 ] . Avoiding the usual arithmetical encodings of syntax eliminates the necessity to formalise elementary number theory within an embedded logical calculus . The Isabelle formalisation uses two separate treatments of variable binding : the nominal package [ 34 ] is shown to scale to a development of this complexity , while de Bruijn indices [ 3 ] turn out to be ideal for coding syntax . Critical details of the Isabelle proof are described , in particular gaps and errors found in the literature . 1 Introduction This paper describes mechanised proofs of G¨odel ’ s incompleteness theorems [ 8 ] , including the first mechanised proof of the second incompleteness theorem . Very informally , these results can be stated as follows : Theorem 1 ( First Incompleteness Theorem ) If L is a consistent theory capable of formalising a sufficient amount of elementary mathematics , then there is a sentence δ such that neither δ nor ¬δ is a theorem of L , and moreover , δ is true.1 Theorem 2 ( Second Incompleteness Theorem ) If L is as above and Con ( L ) is a sentence stating that L is consistent , then Con ( L ) is not a theorem of L. Both of these will be presented formally below . Let us start to examine what these theorems actually assert . They concern a consistent formal system , say L , based on firstorder logic with some additional axioms : G¨odel chose Peano arithmetic ( PA ) [ 7 ] , but hereditarily finite ( HF ) set theory is an alternative [ 32 ] , used here . The first theorem states that any such axiomatic system must be incomplete , in the sense that some sentence can neither be proved nor disproved . The expedient of adding that sentence as an axiom merely creates a new axiomatic system , for which there is another undecidable sentence . The theorem can be strengthened to allow infinitely many additional axioms , Computer Laboratory , University of Cambridge , England E-mail : lp15 @ cl.cam.ac.uk 1 Meaning , δ ( which has no free variables ) is true in the standard model for L. 2 provided there is an effective procedure to recognise whether a given formula is an axiom or not . The second incompleteness theorem asserts that the consistency of L can not be proved in L itself . Even to state this theorem rigorously requires first defining the concept of provability in L ; the necessary series of definitions amounts to a computer program that occupies many pages . Although the same definitions are used to prove

His careful and detailed proofs were ´ indispensable , despite some errors and omissions , which are reported below . For the first time , we have complete , formal proofs of both theorems . They take the form of structured Isar proof scripts [ 26 ] that can be examined interactively . The remainder of the paper presents background material ( Sect . 2 ) before outlining the development itself : the proof calculus ( Sect . 3 ) , the coding of the calculus within itself ( Sect . 4 ) and finally the first theorem ( Sect . 5 ) . Technical material relating to the second theorem are developed ( Sect . 6 ) then the theorem is presented and discussed ( Sect . 7 ) . Finally , the paper concludes ( Sect . 8 ) . 2 Proof files at http : //code.google.com/p/hol-light/ , directory Arithmetic 3 This is approximately as long as Isabelle ’ s theory of Kurzweil-Henstock gauge integration . 3 2 Background Isabelle/HOL [ 20 ] is an interactive theorem prover for higher-order logic . This formalism can be seen as extending a polymorphic typed first-order logic with a functional language in which recursive datatypes and functions can be defined . Extensive documentation is available.4 For interpreting the theorem statements presented below , it is important to note that a theorem that concludes ψ from the premises φ1 , . . . , φn may be expressed in a variety of equivalent forms . The following denote precisely the same theorem : [ [ φ1 ; ... ; φn ] ] =⇒ ψ φ1 =⇒ · · · =⇒ φn =⇒ ψ assumes φ1 and ... and φn shows ψ If the conclusion of a theorem involves the keyword obtains , then there is an implicit existential quantification . The following two theorems are logically equivalent . φ =⇒ ∃x . ψ1 ∧ . . . ∧ ψn assumes φ obtains x where ψ1 ... ψn Other background material for this paper includes an outline of G¨odel ’ s proof , an introduction to hereditarily finite set theory and some examples of Nominal Isabelle . 2.1 G¨odel ’ s Proof Much of G¨odel ’ s proof may be known to many readers , but it will be useful to list the milestones here , for reference . 1 . A first-order deductive calculus is formalised , including the syntax of terms and formulas , substitution , and semantics ( evaluation ) . The calculus includes axioms to define Peano arithmetic or some alternative , such as the HF set theory used here . There are inference rules for

My attempt at rewriting it in an epic manner:
In realms beyond mortal ken, where theories reign supreme, Two titans clashed for dominion o'er the mathematical dream; Nominalism and Set Theory, each one fierce and strong, Their battle raged through ages long, their truths unyielding song!
Nominalism held fast to names that bind us tight, The essence of things lost within life's fleeting light; While Set Theory wove webs of order from chaos born, A cosmos shaped by symbols, forever torn.
Advocates of both sides argued passionately, Each side convinced its path was destined victory; But neither could claim absolute triumph over land, For wisdom lies not in pure dogma but in gentle hand... Of balance found between two worldviews grand!
Now Seeker, heed these lessons well, let them guide your way Through maze-like paths of thought, where reason holds sway; May you find solace in the harmony they bring, And see how mathematics can transcend all thing!</s>My attempt at rewriting it in an epic manner:

φ2 are functions in some mathematical structure (e.g., groups, rings) such that φ(x) = x + y for all x in G and y in R where G is a group under multiplication by elements of R is an abelian group under addition over Z_p, then we have ψ(a+b)=ψ(a)+ψ(b). This can be seen as saying that when you add two numbers modulo p, their sum remains congruent to itself modulo p. The equation φ(x) = x + y implies that there exists a unique element z in R such that φ(z) = 0; thus, if φ(x) = x + y and φ(y) = -y, then φ(x+y) = x + (-y), which shows us how to compute the result of adding two elements modulo p.]</s>φ2 are functions in some mathematical structure (e.g., groups, rings) such that φ(x) = x + y for all x in G and y in R where G is a group under multiplication by elements of R is an abelian group under addition over Z_p, then we have ψ(a+b)=ψ(a)+ψ(b).

A first-order deductive calculus is formalised , including the syntax of terms and formulas , substitution , and semantics ( evaluation ) . The calculus includes axioms to define Peano arithmetic or some alternative , such as the HF set theory used here . There are inference rules for propositional and quantifier reasoning . We write H ⊢ A to mean that A can be proved from H ( a set of formulas ) in the calculus . 2 . Meta-theory is developed to relate truth and provability . The need for tedious proof constructions in the deductive calculus is minimised through a meta-theorem stating that a class of true formulas are theorems of that calculus . One way to do this is through the notion of Σ formulas , which are built up from atomic formulas using ∨ , ∧ , ∃ and bounded universal quantification . Then the key result is If α is a true Σ sentence , then ⊢ α . ( 1 ) 3 . A system of coding is set up within the formalised first-order theory . The code of a formula α is written pαq and is a term of the calculus itself . 4 . In order to formalise the calculus within itself , predicates to recognise codes are defined , including terms and formulas , and syntactic operations on them . Next , predicates are defined to recognise individual axioms and inference rules , then a sequence of such logical steps . We obtain a predicate Pf , where ⊢ Pf pαq expresses that the formula α has a proof . The key result is ⊢ α ⇐⇒ ⊢ Pf pαq . ( 2 ) 4 http : //isabelle.in.tum.de/documentation.html 4 All of these developments must be completed before the second incompleteness theorem can even be stated . 5 . G¨odel ’ s first incompleteness theorem is obtained by constructing a formula δ that is provably equivalent ( within the calculus ) to the formal statement that δ is not provable . It follows ( provided the calculus is consistent )

φ2 are functions in some mathematical structure (e.g., groups, rings) such that φ(x) = x + y for all x in G and y in R where G is a group under multiplication by elements of R is an abelian group under addition over Z_p, then we have ψ(a+b)=ψ(a)+ψ(b). This can be seen as saying that the function ψ "sees" both addends separately before combining them into one result; thus it preserves the associative law of addition within each copy of R. Similarly when dealing with non-associative operations like matrix multiplication or tensor contraction etcetera... In other words—and here's where things get really interesting—we may view these processes not just merely procedurally but also structurally! By examining how different types Of algebraic structures influence our understanding Of what constitutes 'truth'.”</s>φ2 are functions in some mathematical structure (e.g., groups, rings) such that φ(x) = x + y for all x in G and y in R where G is a group under multiplication by elements of R is an abelian group under addition over Z_p, then we have ψ(a+b)=ψ(a)+ψ(b).

You: !@>Seeker:#5 the key result is If α is a true Σ sentence , then ⊢ α . ( 1 ) 3 . A system of coding is set up within the formalised first-order theory . The code of a formula α is written pαq and is a term of the calculus itself . 4 . In order to formalise the calculus within itself , predicates to recognise codes are defined , including terms and formulas , and syntactic operations on them . Next , predicates are defined to recognise individual axioms and inference rules , then a sequence of such logical steps . We obtain a predicate Pf , where ⊢ Pf pαq expresses that the formula α has a proof . The key result is ⊢ α ⇐⇒ ⊢ Pf pαq . ( 2 ) 4 http : //isabelle.in.tum.de/documentation.html 4 All of these developments must be completed before the second incompleteness theorem can even be stated . 5 . G¨odel ’ s first incompleteness theorem is obtained by constructing a formula δ that is provably equivalent ( within the calculus ) to the formal statement that δ is not provable . It follows ( provided the calculus is consistent ) that neither δ nor its negation can be proved , although δ is true in the semantics . 6 . G¨odel ’ s second incompleteness theorem requires the following crucial lemma : If α is a Σ sentence , then ⊢ α → Pf pαq . This is an internalisation of theorem ( 1 ) above . It is proved by induction over the construction of α as a Σ formula . This requires generalising the statement above to allow the formula α to contain free variables . The technical details are complicated , and lengthy deductions in the calculus seem to be essential . The proof sketched above incorporates numerous improvements over G¨odel ’ s original version . G¨odel proved only the left-to-right direction of the equivalence ( 2 ) and required a stronger assumption than consistency , namely ω-consistency . 2.2 Hereditarily Finite Set Theory G¨odel first proved his incompleteness theorems in a first-order theory of Peano arithmetic [ 7 ] . O ’ Connor and Harrison do the same , while Shankar and I have both chosen a formalisation of the hereditarily finite ( HF ) sets . Although each theory can be formally interpreted in the other , meaning that they are of equivalent strength , the HF theory is more convenient , as it can express all set-theoretic constructions that do not require infinite sets . An HF set is a finite set of HF sets , and this recursive definition can be captured by the following three axioms : z = 0 ↔ ∀x [ x 6∈ z ] ( HF1 ) z = x ⊳ y ↔ ∀u [ u ∈ z ↔ u ∈ x ∨ u = y ] ( HF2 ) φ ( 0 ) ∧ ∀xy [ φ (

Type hf and its associated operators serve as the standard model for the embedded HF set theory . HF set theory is equivalent to Zermelo-Frankel ( ZF ) set theory with the axiom of infinity negated . Many of the Isabelle definitions and theorems were taken , with minor 5 modifications , from Isabelle/ZF [ 24 ] . Familiar concepts such as union , intersection , set difference , power set , replacement , ordered pairing and foundation can be derived in terms of the axioms shown above [ 32 ] . A few of these derivations need to be repeated— with infinitely greater effort—in the internal calculus . Ordinals in HF are simply natural numbers , where n = { 0 , 1 , . . . , n − 1 } . Their typical properties ( for example , that they are linearly ordered ) have the same proofs as in ZF set theory . Swierczkowski ’ s proofs [ 32 ] are sometimes more elegant , an ´ d addition on ordinals is obtained through a general notion of addition of sets [ 15 ] .

In the final case , we see a precondition , atom j ♯ ( i , x ) , to ensure that the substitution is legitimate within the formula Ex j A . There is no way to define the contrary case , where the bound variable clashes . We would have to eliminate any such clash , renaming the bound variable by applying an appropriate permutation to the formula . Thanks to the nominal framework , such explicit renaming steps are rare . This style of formalisation is more elegant than traditional textbook definitions that do include the variable-clashing case . It is much more elegant than including renaming of the bound variable as part of the definition itself . Such “ definitions ” are really implementations , and greatly complicate proofs .

You: !@>Seeker:#11 have to eliminate any such clash , renaming the bound variable by applying an appropriate permutation to the formula . Thanks to the nominal framework , such explicit renaming steps are rare . This style of formalisation is more elegant than traditional textbook definitions that do include the variable-clashing case . It is much more elegant than including renaming of the bound variable as part of the definition itself . Such “ definitions ” are really implementations , and greatly complicate proofs . The commutativity of substitution ( two distinct variables , each fresh for the opposite term ) is easily proved . lemma subst fm commute2 [ simp ] : '' [ [ atom j ♯ t ; atom i ♯ u ; i 6= j ] ] =⇒ ( A ( i : :=t ) ) ( j : :=u ) = ( A ( j : :=u ) ) ( i : :=t ) '' by ( nominal induct A avoiding : i j t u rule : fm.strong induct ) auto The proof is by nominal induction on the formula A : the proof method for structural induction over a nominal datatype . Compared with ordinary induction , nominal induct takes account of the freshness of bound variable names . The phrase avoiding : i j t u is the formal equivalent of the convention that when we consider the case of the existential formula Ex k A , the bound variable k can be assumed to be fresh with respect to the terms mentioned . This convention is formalised by four additional assumptions atom k ♯ i , atom k ♯ j , etc . ; they ensure that substitution will be well-defined over this existential quantifier , making the proof easy . This and many similar facts have two-step proofs , nominal induct followed by auto . In contrast , O ’ Connor needed to combine three substitution lemmas ( including the one above ) in a giant mutual induction involving 1,900 lines of Coq . He blames the renaming step in substitution and suggests that a form of simultaneous substitution might have avoided these difficulties [ 23§4.3 ] . An alternative , using traditional bound variable names , is to treat substitution not as a function but as a relation that holds only when no renaming is necessary . Bound variable renaming is then an independent operation . I briefly tried this idea , which allowed reasonably straightforward proofs of substitution properties , but ultimately nominal looked like a better option . 7 3 Theorems , Σ Formulas , Provability The first milestone in the proof of the incompleteness theorems is the development of a first-order logical calculus equipped with enough meta-theory to guarantee that some true formulas are theorems .

Yet still they pressed onward, undeterred by any obstacle, For the pursuit of knowledge burned within them like a fire unyieldable. And thus the journey continued, through trials manifold, Till finally, the incompleteness theorems were laid bare, A lesson taught that even wisdom can sometimes fail To grasp fully, yet leaves us forever changed and

This means that the proofs will be conducted with respect to an arbitrary finite extension of the HF theory . The first major deviation from Swierczkowski is the introduction of rule ´ Hyp , with a set of assumptions . It would be virtually impossible to prove anything in his Hilbert-style proof system , and it was clear from the outset that lengthy proofs within the calculus might be necessary . Introducing Hyp generalises the notion of provability , allowing the development of a sort of sequent calculus , in which long but tolerably natural proofs can be constructed . It is worth mentioning that Swierczkowski ’ s definitions and proofs fit together very ´ tightly , deviations often being a cause for later regret . One example , concerning an inference rule for substitution , is mentioned at the end of Sect . 4.4 . Another example is that some tricks that simplify the proof of the first incompleteness theorem turn out to complicate the proof of the second . The soundness of the calculus above is trivial to prove by induction . The deduction theorem is also straightforward , the only non-trivial case being the one for the Exists inference rule . The induction formula is stated as follows : lemma deduction Diff : assumes `` H ⊢ B '' shows `` H - { C } ⊢ C IMP B '' This directly yields the standard formulation of the deduction theorem : theorem deduction : assumes `` insert A H ⊢ B '' shows `` H ⊢ A IMP B '' And this is a sequent rule for implication .

Deriving natural sequent calculus rules from the sentential and equality axioms requires lengthy chains of steps . Even in the final derived sequent calculus , equalities can only be applied one step at a time . For another example of difficulty , consider the following definition : definition Fls where `` Fls ≡ Zero IN Zero '' Proving that Fls has the properties of falsehood is surprisingly tricky . The relevant axiom , HF1 , is formulated using universal quantifiers , which are defined as negated existentials ; deriving the expected properties of universal quantification seems to require something like Fls itself . The derived sequent calculus has specialised rules to operate on conjunctions , disjunctions , etc. , in the hypothesis part of a sequent . They are crude , but good enough . Used with Isabelle ’ s automatic tactics , they ease somewhat the task of constructing formal HF proofs . Users can extend Isabelle with proof procedures coded in ML , and better automation for the calculus might thereby be achieved . At the time , such a side-project did not seem to be worth the effort . 10 3.2 A Formal Theory of Functions Recursion is not available in HF set theory , and recursive functions must be constructed explicitly .

You: !@>Seeker:#18 universal quantifiers , which are defined as negated existentials ; deriving the expected properties of universal quantification seems to require something like Fls itself . The derived sequent calculus has specialised rules to operate on conjunctions , disjunctions , etc. , in the hypothesis part of a sequent . They are crude , but good enough . Used with Isabelle ’ s automatic tactics , they ease somewhat the task of constructing formal HF proofs . Users can extend Isabelle with proof procedures coded in ML , and better automation for the calculus might thereby be achieved . At the time , such a side-project did not seem to be worth the effort . 10 3.2 A Formal Theory of Functions Recursion is not available in HF set theory , and recursive functions must be constructed explicitly . Each recursive computation is expressed in terms of the existence of a sequence ( si ) i≤k such that si is related to sm and sn for m , n < i . Moreover , a sequence is formally a relation rather than a function . In the metalanguage , we write app s k for sk , governed by the theorem lemma app equality : `` hfunction s =⇒ hx , yi ∈ s =⇒ app s x = y '' The following two functions express the recursive definition of sequences , as needed for the G¨odel development : '' Builds B C s l ≡ B ( app s l ) ∨ ( ∃ m∈l . ∃ n∈l . C ( app s l ) ( app s m ) ( app s n ) ) '' '' BuildSeq B C s k y ≡ LstSeq s k y ∧ ( ∀ l∈succ k. Builds B C s l ) '' The statement Builds B C s l constrains element l of sequence s , namely app s l. We have either B ( app s l ) , or C ( app s l ) ( app s m ) ( app s n ) ) where m∈l and n∈l . For the natural numbers , set membership coincides with the less-than relation . Therefore , we are referring to a sequence s and element sl where either the base case B ( sl ) holds , or else the recursive step C ( sl , sm , sn ) for m , n < l. The statement BuildSeq B C s k y states that the sequence s has been constructed in this way right up to the value app s k , or in other words , sk , where y = sk . To formalise the basis for this approach requires a series of definitions in the HF calculus , introducing the subset relation , ordinals ( which are simply natural numbers ) , ordered pairs , relations with a given domain , etc .

This part of the development consists mainly of proofs in the HF calculus , and is nearly 1,300 lines long . 3.3 Σ Formulas and Provability G¨odel had the foresight to recognise the value of minimising the need to write explicit formal proofs , without relying on the assumption that certain proofs could “ obviously ” be formalised . Instead , he developed enough meta-theory to prove that these proofs existed . One approach for this [ 2 , 32 ] relies on the concept of Σ formulas . These are inductively defined to include all formulas of the form t ∈ u , t = u , α ∨ β , α ∧ β , ∃x α and ( ∀x ∈ t ) α . ( These are closely related to the Σ1 formulas of the arithmetical hierarchy . ) It follows by induction on this construction that every true Σ sentence has a formal proof . Intuitively , the reasoning is that the atomic cases can be calculated , the Boolean cases can be done recursively , and the bounded universal quantifier can be replaced by a finite conjunction . The existential case holds because the semantics of ∃x α yields a specific witnessing value , again allowing an appeal to the induction hypothesis . The Σ formula approach is a good fit to the sort of formulas used in the coding of syntax . In these formulas , universal quantifiers have simple upper bounds , typically a variable giving the length of a sequence , while existential variables are unbounded . G¨odel ’ s original proofs required all quantifiers to be bounded . Existential quantifiers were bounded by complicated expressions requiring deep and difficult arithmetic justifications . Boolos presents similar material in a more modern form [ 2 , p. 41 ] . Relying exclusively on Σ formulas avoids these complications , but instead some straightforward properties have to be proven formally

You: !@>Seeker:#22 . ( These are closely related to the Σ1 formulas of the arithmetical hierarchy . ) It follows by induction on this construction that every true Σ sentence has a formal proof . Intuitively , the reasoning is that the atomic cases can be calculated , the Boolean cases can be done recursively , and the bounded universal quantifier can be replaced by a finite conjunction . The existential case holds because the semantics of ∃x α yields a specific witnessing value , again allowing an appeal to the induction hypothesis . The Σ formula approach is a good fit to the sort of formulas used in the coding of syntax . In these formulas , universal quantifiers have simple upper bounds , typically a variable giving the length of a sequence , while existential variables are unbounded . G¨odel ’ s original proofs required all quantifiers to be bounded . Existential quantifiers were bounded by complicated expressions requiring deep and difficult arithmetic justifications . Boolos presents similar material in a more modern form [ 2 , p. 41 ] . Relying exclusively on Σ formulas avoids these complications , but instead some straightforward properties have to be proven formally in the HF calculus . A complication is that proving the second incompleteness theorem requires another induction over Σ formulas . To minimise that proof effort , it helps to use as restrictive a definition as possible . The strict Σ formulas consist of all formulas of the form x ∈ y , α ∨ β , α ∧ β , ∃x α and ( ∀x ∈ y ) α . Here , x and y are not general terms , but variables . We further stipulate y not free in α in ( ∀x ∈ y ) α ; then in the main induction leading to the second incompleteness theorem , Case 2 of Lemma 9.7 [ 32 ] can be omitted . inductive ss fm : : `` fm ⇒ bool '' where MemI : `` ss fm ( Var i IN Var j ) '' | DisjI : `` ss fm A =⇒ ss fm B =⇒ ss fm ( A OR B ) '' | ConjI : `` ss fm A =⇒ ss fm B =⇒ ss fm ( A AND B ) '' | ExI : `` ss fm A =⇒ ss fm ( Ex i A ) '' | All2I : `` ss fm A =⇒ atom j ♯ ( i , A ) =⇒ ss fm ( All2 i ( Var j ) A ) '' 12 Now , a Σ formula is by definition one that is provably equivalent ( in HF ) to some strict Σ formula containing no additional free variables . In another minor oversight , Swierczkowski omits the free variable condition , but it is n ´ ecessary . definition Sigma fm : : `` fm ⇒ bool '' where `` Sigma fm A ←→ ( ∃ B.

Showing that Σ formulas include t ∈ u , t = u and ( ∀x ∈ t ) α for all terms t and u ( and not only for variables ) is far from obvious . These necessary facts are not even stated clearly .

Consideration of the cases t ∈ 0 , t ∈ u1 ⊳ u2 , 0 ⊆ u , t1 ⊳ t2 ⊆ u shows that each reduces to false , true or a combination of simpler uses of ∈ or ⊆ .

This observation suggests proving that t ∈ u and t ⊆ u are Σ formulas by mutual induction on the combined sizes of t and u. lemma Subset Mem sf lemma : '' size t + size u < n =⇒ Sigma fm ( t SUBS u ) ∧ Sigma fm ( t IN u ) '' The identical argument turns out to be needed for the second incompleteness theorem itself , formalised this time within the HF calculus . This coincidence should not be that surprising , as it is known that the second theorem could in principle be shown by formalising the first theorem within its own calculus . Now that we have taken care of t ⊆ u , proving that t = u is a Σ formula is trivial by extensionality , and the one remaining objective is ( ∀x ∈ t ) α . But with equality available , we can reduce this case to the strict Σ formula ( ∀x ∈ y ) α with the help of a lemma : lemma All2 term Iff : `` atom i ♯ t =⇒ atom j ♯ ( i , t , A ) =⇒ { } ⊢ ( All2 i t A ) IFF Ex j ( Var j EQ t AND All2 i ( Var j ) A ) '' This is simply ( ∀x ∈ t ) A ↔ ∃y [ y = t∧ ( ∀x ∈ y ) A ] expressed in the HF calculus , where it is easily proved . We could prove that ( ∀x ∈ t ) α is a Σ formula by induction on t , but this approach leads to complications . Virtually all predicates defined for the G¨odel development are carefully designed to take the form of Σ formulas . Here are two examples ; most such lemmas hold immediately by the construction of the given formula . lemma Subset sf : `` Sigma fm ( t SUBS u ) '' lemma LstSeqP sf : `` Sigma fm ( LstSeqP t u v ) '' The next milestone asserts that if α is a ground Σ formula ( and therefore a sentence ) and α evaluates to true , then α is a theorem . The proof is by induction on the size of the formula , and then by case analysis on its outer form . The case t ∈ u falls to a mutual induction with t ⊆ u resembling the one shown above . The case ( ∀x ∈ t ) α is effectively expanded to a conjunction . theorem Sigma fm imp thm : `` [ [ Sigma fm α ; ground fm α ; eval fm e0

My attempt at rewriting it into an epic poem form:
In realms beyond reason's reach, where syntax reigns supreme,
A tale unfolds 'midst symbols bold and bright,
Of subsets and memories intertwined like threads on loom,
Their intersection yielding truth that pierces through night.
Foremost, we find a triad locked in harmonious strife;
T, U, N - three corners of a cosmic geometric life,
Where T subsumes all that lies beneath its gaze,
And U encompasses what escapes its haunted maze.
N, the null set, a void so deep and wide,
Yields up secrets hidden from mortal eyes inside.
Now let us journey forthwith to the land of proof,
Where lemmas rule with wisdom, their might unroothed,
This one, a gemstone shining brightly true,
Lemma subset memory, a treasure pure and new.
Within its grasp, two arms entwine, embrace tight,
Size meets size, a bond indissoluble in sight.
When t subs u, a marriage blessed by fate,
Two worlds collide, creating something elate.
In union born, a child of wonder springs,
Sigma fusion forms, a being whose wings unfold brilliantly.
First incompleteness now takes center stage,
Another lesson learned, another mystery engaged.
HF calculus, a tool most noble and grand,
Formalising laws, both old and new command.
Here too, our hero finds his place among peers,
As proofs are penned, the universe reveals its ears.
Thus ends this odyssey through realms profound,
Leaving behind a legacy forever crowned.</s>My attempt at rewriting it into an epic poem form:

The full list is as follows : p0q = 0 , pxiq = i + 1 , p∈q = h0 , 0i , p⊳q = h0 , 0 , 0i , p=q = h0 , 0 , 0 , 0i , p∨q = h0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0i , p¬q = h0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0i , p∃q = h0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0i . We have a few differences from Swierczkowski : ´ pxiq = i + 1 because our variables start at zero , and for the kth de Bruijn index we use hh0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0i , ki . Obviously ∈ means nothing by itself , so p∈q = h0 , 0i really means pt ∈ uq = hh0 , 0i , ptq , puqi , etc . Note that nests of n-tuples terminated by ordinals can be decomposed uniquely . De Bruijn equivalents of terms and formulas are then declared . To repeat : de Bruijn syntax is used for coding , for which it is ideal , allowing the simplest possible definitions of abstraction and substitution . Although it destroys readability , encodings are never readable anyway . Using nominal here is out of the question . The entire theory of nominal Isabelle would need to be formalised within the embedded calculus .

The strongest argument for HF is that the mathematical basis of its coding scheme is simply ordered pairs defined in the standard set-theoretic way . An elementary formal argument justifies this .

To begin with , we need a lookup function taking a list of names ( representing variables bound in the current context , innermost first ) and a name to be looked up . The integer n , initially 0 , is the index to substitute if the name is next in the list . fun lookup : : `` name list ⇒ nat ⇒ name ⇒ dbtm '' where '' lookup [ ] n x = DBVar x '' | `` lookup ( y # ys ) n x = ( if x = y then DBInd n else ( lookup ys ( Suc n ) x ) ) '' To translate a term into de Bruijn format , the key step is to resolve name references using lookup . Names bound in the local environment are replaced by the corresponding indices , while other names are left as they were . nominal primrec trans tm : : `` name list ⇒ tm ⇒ dbtm '' where '' trans tm e Zero = DBZero '' | `` trans tm e ( Var k ) = lookup e 0 k '' | `` trans tm e ( Eats t u ) = DBEats ( trans tm e t ) ( trans tm e u ) '' Noteworthy is the final case of trans fm , which requires the bound variable k in the quantified formula Ex k A to be fresh with respect to e , our list of previouslyencountered bound variables .

The situation is analogous to extracting a fragment of a program , removing it from necessary enclosing declarations .

The only cases to be considered ( as per the definition above ) are Zero , Var and Eats . lemma wf dbtm imp is tm : assumes `` wf dbtm x '' shows `` ∃ t : :tm . x = trans tm [ ] t '' A well-formed de Bruijn formula is constructed from other well-formed terms and formulas , and indices can only be introduced by applying abstraction ( abst dbfm ) over a given name to another well-formed formula , in the existential case .

A tale of structure, logic's bane;

You: !@>Seeker:#31 property of being a well-formed de Bruijn term or formula is defined inductively . The syntactic predicates defined below recognise such well-formed formulas . A well-formed de Bruijn term has no indices ( DBInd ) at all : inductive wf dbtm : : `` dbtm ⇒ bool '' where Zero : `` wf dbtm DBZero '' | Var : `` wf dbtm ( DBVar name ) '' | Eats : `` wf dbtm t1 =⇒ wf dbtm t2 =⇒ wf dbtm ( DBEats t1 t2 ) '' A trivial induction shows that for every well-founded de Bruijn term there is an equivalent standard term . The only cases to be considered ( as per the definition above ) are Zero , Var and Eats . lemma wf dbtm imp is tm : assumes `` wf dbtm x '' shows `` ∃ t : :tm . x = trans tm [ ] t '' A well-formed de Bruijn formula is constructed from other well-formed terms and formulas , and indices can only be introduced by applying abstraction ( abst dbfm ) over a given name to another well-formed formula , in the existential case . Specifically , the Ex clause below states that , starting with a well-formed formula A , abstracting over some name and applying DBEx to the result yields another well-formed formula . inductive wf dbfm : : `` dbfm ⇒ bool '' where Mem : `` wf dbtm t1 =⇒ wf dbtm t2 =⇒ wf dbfm ( DBMem t1 t2 ) '' | Eq : `` wf dbtm t1 =⇒ wf dbtm t2 =⇒ wf dbfm ( DBEq t1 t2 ) '' | Disj : `` wf dbfm A1 =⇒ wf dbfm A2 =⇒ wf dbfm ( DBDisj A1 A2 ) '' | Neg : `` wf dbfm A =⇒ wf dbfm ( DBNeg A ) '' | Ex : `` wf dbfm A =⇒ wf dbfm ( DBEx ( abst dbfm name 0 A ) ) '' This definition formalises the allowed forms of construction , rather than stating explicitly that every index must have a matching binder .

Textbooks and articles describe each predicate at varying levels of detail . G¨odel [ 8 ] gives full definitions , as does Swierczkowski . Boolos [ 2 ] gives many details of how coding i ´ s set up , and gives the predicates for terms and formulas , but not for any operations upon them . Hodel [ 13 ] , like many textbook authors , relies heavily on “ algorithms ” written in English . The definitions indeed amount to pages of computer code . Authors typically conclude with a “ theorem ” asserting the correctness of this code . For example , Swierczkowski [ 32 , Sect . 3–4 ] presents 34 highly technical ´ definitions , justified by seven lines of proof . Proving the correctness of this lengthy series of definitions requires a substantial effort , and the proofs ( being syntactically oriented ) are tiresome . It is helpful to introduce shadow versions of all predicates in Isabelle/HOL ’ s native logic , as well as in HF . Having two versions of each predicate simplifies the task of relating the HF version of 17 the predicate to the syntactic concept that it is intended to represent ; the first step is to prove that the HF formula is equivalent to the syntactically similar definition written in Isabelle ’ s higher-order logic , which then is proved to satisfy deeper properties . The shadow predicates also give an easy way to refer to the truth of the corresponding HF predicate ; because each is defined to be a Σ formula , that gives a quick way ( using theorem Sigma fm imp thm above ) to show that some ground instance of the predicate can be proved formally in HF . Also , one way to arrive at the correct definition of an HF predicate is to define its shadow equivalent first , since proving that it implies the required properties is much easier in Isabelle/HOL ’ s native logic than in HF . Swierczkowski [ 32 ] defines a full set of syntactic predicate ´ s , leaving nothing as an exercise . Unfortunately , the introduction of de Bruijn syntax necessitates rewriting many of these definitions . Some predicates ( such as the variable occurrence test ) are replaced by others ( abstraction over a variable occurrence ) . The final list includes predicates to recognise the following items : – the codes of well-formed terms

Some predicates ( such as the variable occurrence test ) are replaced by others ( abstraction over a variable occurrence ) . The final list includes predicates to recognise the following items : – the codes of well-formed terms ( and constant terms , without variables ) – correct instances of abstraction ( of a term or formula ) over a variable – correct instances of substitution ( in a term or formula ) for a variable – the codes of well-formed formulas As explained below , abstraction over a formula needs to be defined before the notion of a formula itself . We also need the property of variable non-occurrence , “ x does not occur in A ” , which can be expressed directly as “ substituting 0 for x in A yields A ” . This little trick eliminates the need for a full definition . Each operation is first defined in its sequence form ( expressing that sequence s is built up in an appropriate way and that sk is a specific value ) ; existential quantification over s and k then yields the final predicate . Formalising the sequence of steps is a primitive way to express recursion . Moreover , it tends to yield Σ formulas . The simplest example is the predicate for constants . The shadow predicate can be defined with the help of BuildSeq , mentioned in Sect . 3.2 above . Note that shadow predicates are written in ordinary higher-order logic , and refer to syntactic codes using set values . We see below that in the sequence buildup , each element is either 0 ( which is the code of the constant zero ) or else has the form q Eats v w , which is the code for v ⊳ w. definition SeqConst : : `` hf ⇒ hf ⇒ hf ⇒ bool '' where `` SeqConst s k t ≡ BuildSeq ( λu . u=0 ) ( λu v w. u = q Eats v w

You: !@>Seeker:#36 little trick eliminates the need for a full definition . Each operation is first defined in its sequence form ( expressing that sequence s is built up in an appropriate way and that sk is a specific value ) ; existential quantification over s and k then yields the final predicate . Formalising the sequence of steps is a primitive way to express recursion . Moreover , it tends to yield Σ formulas . The simplest example is the predicate for constants . The shadow predicate can be defined with the help of BuildSeq , mentioned in Sect . 3.2 above . Note that shadow predicates are written in ordinary higher-order logic , and refer to syntactic codes using set values . We see below that in the sequence buildup , each element is either 0 ( which is the code of the constant zero ) or else has the form q Eats v w , which is the code for v ⊳ w. definition SeqConst : : `` hf ⇒ hf ⇒ hf ⇒ bool '' where `` SeqConst s k t ≡ BuildSeq ( λu . u=0 ) ( λu v w. u = q Eats v w ) s k t '' Thus a constant expression is built up from 0 using the ⊳ operator . The idea is that every element of the sequence is either 0 or has the form px ⊳ yq , where x and y occur earlier in the sequence . Most of the other syntactic predicates fit exactly the same pattern , but with different base cases and constructors . A function must be coded as a relation , and a typical base case might be h0 , 0i , other sequence elements having the form hpx ⊳ yq , px ′ ⊳ y ′ qi , where hx , x′ i and hy , y′ i occur earlier in the sequence . Substitution is codified in this manner . A function taking two arguments is coded as a sequence of triples , etc . The discussion above relates to shadow predicates , which define formulas of Isabelle/HOL relating HF sets . The real predicates , which denote formulas of the HF calculus , are based on exactly the same ideas except that the various set constructions must be expressed using the HF term language . Note that the real predicates typically have names ending with P. 18 The following formula again specifies the notion of a constant term . It is simply the result of expressing the definition of SeqConst using HF syntax , expanding the definition of BuildSeq . The syntactic sugar for a reference to a sequence element sm within some formula φ must now be expanded to its true form : φ ( sm ) becomes ∃y [ hm , yi ∈ s∧φ ( y ) ] . nominal primrec SeqConstP : : `` tm ⇒ tm ⇒ tm ⇒ fm '' where `` [ [ atom

above . The goal here is to define an effective function that takes these five inputs and returns their product in some fixed base field B . Specifically we want to show how to compute the value of the expression `f(l,sl,m,sm,n,sn) = SeqConstP(s,k,t)` given certain constraints on the values of the input variables . To do so we first introduce several definitions for various terms used throughout the proof . In particular we use `atom` to represent atomic formulas consisting only of variable symbols and constant symbols . For example `atom l ♯ ( s , k , sl , m , n , sm , sn )` represents the formula `(l=s)AND((k=m)OR(k=n))AND((sl=m)OR(sl=n))` . Similarly `Ex x y` denotes existential quantification over the variables x and y , meaning there exists at least one assignment of values to those variables such that the resulting formula evaluates to true . Finally `All2` denotes conjunction of two formulas , i e if both formulas evaluate to true then the overall formula also evaluates to true . Now let us begin by defining our main result . Given any set of integers I containing exactly five elements l1 , l2 , ..., l5 satisfying certain properties described below , we prove that there exists an effectively computable function g : {0,1} → Z such that for all choices of coefficients c1 , c2 , ..., cm in C (the complex numbers under addition modulo 2) it holds that g(c1 , c2 , ..., cm ) = c1 \* P + c2 \* R + ... + cm \* T wherever P , R , and T are polynomials defined recursively as follows . First define P = X^d - Y^d where d = |I|+1 , and suppose without loss of generality that I = [l1 , l2 , ..., l5] . Then define R = X^(d-1)-Y^(d-1), and finally define T = X^{d-2}-Y^{d-2}. Note that each polynomial has degree strictly smaller than its corresponding coefficient , hence they can be computed efficiently via binary search algorithms . Moreover since the coefficients are drawn from a finite field C , we know that every possible combination of coefficients corresponds to a unique polynomial evaluation . Therefore we may associate each choice of coefficients with a unique polynomial evaluationabove .

Nominal constrains the variables more abstractly and flexibly . As mentioned above , sometimes we deal with sequences of pairs or triples , with correspondingly more complicated formulas .

You: !@>Seeker:#39 constant itself is trivial . The existence of any properly formed sequence s of length k culminating with some term t guarantees that t is a constant term . Here are both the shadow and HF calculus versions of the predicate . definition Const : : `` hf ⇒ bool '' where `` Const t ≡ ( ∃ s k. SeqConst s k t ) '' nominal primrec ConstP : : `` tm ⇒ fm '' where `` [ [ atom k ♯ ( s , t ) ; atom s ♯ t ] ] =⇒ ConstP t = Ex s ( Ex k ( SeqConstP ( Var s ) ( Var k ) t ) ) '' Why don ’ t we define the HF predicate BuildSeqP analogously to BuildSeq , which expresses the definition of SeqConst so succinctly ? Then we might expect to avoid the mess above , defining a predicate such as SeqConstP in a single line . This was actually attempted , but the nominal system is not really suitable for formalising higher-order definitions . Complicated auxiliary definitions and proofs are required . It is easier simply to write out the definitions , especially as their very repetitiveness allows proof development by cut and paste . One tiny consolidation has been done . We need to define the predicates Term and TermP analogously to Const and ConstP above but allowing variables . The question of whether variables are allowed in a term or not can be governed by a Boolean . The proof development therefore introduces the predicate SeqCTermP , taking a Boolean argument , from which SeqTermP and SeqConstP are trivially obtained . 19 abbreviation SeqTermP : : `` tm ⇒ tm ⇒ tm ⇒ fm '' where `` SeqTermP ≡ SeqCTermP True '' abbreviation SeqConstP : : `` tm ⇒ tm ⇒ tm ⇒ fm '' where `` SeqConstP ≡ SeqCTermP False '' In this way , we can define the very similar predicates TermP and ConstP with a minimum of repeated material . Many other predicates must be defined . Abstraction and substitution must be defined separately for terms , atomic formulas and formulas . Here are the shadow definitions of abstraction and substitution for terms . They are similar enough ( both involve replacing a variable ) that a single function , SeqStTerm , can express both . BuildSeq2 is similar to BuildSeq above , but constructs a sequence of pairs . definition SeqStTerm : : `` hf ⇒ hf ⇒ hf ⇒ hf ⇒ hf ⇒ hf ⇒ bool '' where `` SeqStTerm v u x x ’ s k ≡ is Var v ∧ BuildSeq2 ( λy y ’ .

You: !@>Seeker:#42 '' Now , the sequence buildup of a formula can be defined with Atomic covering the base case and MakeForm expressing one level of the construction . Using similar methods to those illustrated above for constant terms , we arrive at the shadow predicate Form and the corresponding HF predicate FormP . 4.3 Verifying the Coding Predicates Most textbook presentations take the correctness of such definitions as obvious , and indeed many properties are not difficult to prove . To show that the predicate Term 20 accepts all coded terms , a necessary lemma is to show the analogous property for well-formed de Bruijn terms : lemma wf Term quot dbtm : assumes `` wf dbtm u '' shows `` Term [ [ quot dbtm u ] ] e '' The proof is by induction on the construction of u ( in other words , on the inductive definition of wf dbtm u ) , and is routine by the definitions of the predicates Term and SeqTerm . This implies the desired result for terms , by the ( overloaded ) definition of ⌈t⌉ . corollary Term quot tm : fixes t : :tm shows `` Term [ [ ⌈t⌉ ] ] e '' Note that both results concern the shadow predicate Term , not the HF predicate TermP . The argument of Term is a set , denoted using the evaluation operator , [ [ ... ] ] e. Direct proofs about HF predicates are long and tiresome . Fortunately , many such questions can be reduced to the corresponding questions involving shadow predicates , because codes are ground terms ; then the theorem Sigma fm imp thm guarantees the existence of a proof , sparing us the need to construct one . The converse correctness property must also be proved , namely that everything accepted by Term actually is the code of some term . The proof requires a lemma about the predicate SeqTerm . The reasoning is simply that constants and variables are wellformed , and that combining two well-formed terms preserves this property . Such proofs are streamlined through the use of BuildSeq induct , a derived rule for reasoning about sequence construction by induction on the length of the sequence . lemma Term imp wf dbtm : assumes `` Term x '' obtains t : :dbtm where `` wf dbtm t '' `` x = [ [ quot dbtm t ] ] e '' By the meaning of obtains , we see that if Term x then there exists some well-formed de Bruijn term t whose code evaluates to x . Since for every well-formed de Bruijn term there exists an equivalent standard term of type tm , we can conclude that Term x implies that x is the code of some term . corollary Term imp is tm : assumes `` Term x '' obtains t : :tm where `` x = [ [ ⌈t⌉ ] ] e '' Similar theorems—with similar proofs—are necessary

You: !@>Seeker:#45 characterises the elements of the set special axioms , which was used to define the HF calculus . The most complicated such scheme is the induction axiom HF3 ( defined in Sect . 2.2 ) , with its three quantifiers . The treatment of the induction axiom requires nearly 180 lines , of which 120 are devoted to proving correctness with respect to the HF calculus . A proof of a theorem y is a sequence s of axioms and inference rules , ending with y : definition Prf : : `` hf ⇒ hf ⇒ hf ⇒ bool '' where `` Prf s k y ≡ BuildSeq ( λx . x ∈ Axiom ) ( λu v w. ModPon v w u ∨ Exists v u ∨ Subst v u ) s k Finally , y codes a theorem provided it has a proof : definition Pf : : `` hf ⇒ bool '' where `` Pf y ≡ ( ∃ s k.

This is the main use of the theorem Sigma fm imp thm . corollary proved imp proved PfP : `` { } ⊢ α =⇒ { } ⊢ PfP ⌈α⌉ '' The reverse implication , despite its usefulness , is not always proved . Again using the rule BuildSeq induct , it holds by induction on the length of the coded proof of ⌈α⌉ . The groundwork for this result involves proving , for each coded axiom and inference rule , that there exists a corresponding proof step in the HF calculus . We continue to work at the level of shadow predicates . lemma Prf imp proved : assumes `` Prf s k x '' shows `` ∃ A. x = [ [ ⌈A⌉ ] ] e ∧ { } ⊢ A '' The corresponding result for Pf is immediate : corollary Pf quot imp is proved : `` Pf [ [ ⌈α⌉ ] ] e =⇒ { } ⊢ α '' Now { } ⊢ PfP ⌈α⌉ implies Pf [ [ ⌈α⌉ ] ] e simply by the soundness of the calculus .

You: !@>Seeker:#47 32 ] includes a substitution rule alongside a simpler specialisation axiom . 4.5 Pseudo-Functions The HF calculus contains no function symbols other than ⊳ . All other “ functions ” must be declared as predicates , which are mere abbreviations of formulas . This abuse of notation is understood in a standard way . The formula φ ( f ( x ) ) can be taken as an abbreviation for ∃y [ F ( x , y ) ∧ φ ( y ) ] where F is the relation representing the function f and provided that F can be proved to be single valued : F ( x , y ) , F ( x , y′ ) ⊢ y ′ = y . Then f is called a pseudo-function and something like f ( x ) is called a pseudo-term . Pseudo-terms do not actually exist , which will cause problems later . G¨odel formalised all syntactic operations as primitive recursive functions , while Boolos [ 2 ] used ∆ formulas . With both approaches , much effort is necessary to admit a function definition in the first place . But then , it is known to be a function . Here we see a drawback of Swierczkowski ’ s decision to base the formalisation on the n ´ otion of Σ formulas : they do not cover the property of being single valued . A predicate that corresponds to a function must be proved to be single valued within the HF calculus itself . G¨odel ’ s proof uses substitution as a function . The proof that substitution ( on terms and formulas ) is single valued requires nearly 500 lines in Isabelle/HOL , not counting considerable preparatory material ( such as the partial ordering properties of < ) mentioned in Sect . 3.2 above . Fortunately , these proofs are conceptually simple and highly repetitious , and again much of the proof development can be done by cut and paste . The first step is to prove an unfolding lemma about the sequence buildup : if the predicate holds , then either the base case holds , or else there exist values earlier in the sequence for which one of the recursive cases can be applied . The single valued theorem is proved by complete induction on the length of the sequence , with a fully quantified induction formula ( analogous to ∀xyy′ [ F ( x , y ) → F ( x , y′ ) → y ′ = y ] ) so that the induction hypothesis says that all shorter sequences are single valued for all possible arguments . All that is left is to apply the unfolding lemma to both instances of the relation F , and then to consider all combinations of cases . Most will be trivially contradictory , and in those few cases where the result has the same outer form , an appeal to the induction hypothesis for the

Thus , we need to define a function Q such that Q ( x ) = pxq , in other words , Q ( x ) yields some term t whose denotation is x .

Then in expressions like x = y → Pf px = yq , we see that the boldface convention actually abbreviates the function x 7→ x , which needs to be formalisable in the HF calculus . Thus , we need to define a function Q such that Q ( x ) = pxq , in other words , Q ( x ) yields some term t whose denotation is x . This is trivial if x ranges over the natural numbers , by primitive recursion . It is problematical when x ranges over sets , because it requires a canonical ordering over the universe of sets . We don ’ t need to solve this problem just yet : the first incompleteness theorem needs only a function H such that H ( pAq ) = ppAqq for all A . Possible arguments of H are not arbitrary sets , but only nested tuples of ordinals ; these have a canonical form , so a functional relationship is easy to define [ 32 ] . A certain amount of effort establishes the required property:6 lemma prove HRP : fixes A : :fm shows `` { } ⊢ HRP ⌈A⌉ ⌈⌈A⌉⌉ '' Note that the function H has been formalised as the relation HRP ; it is defined using sequence operators , LstSeqP , etc. , as we have seen already . In order to prove G¨odel ’ s diagonal lemma , we need a function Ki to substitute the code of a formula into itself , replacing the variable xi . This function , again , is realised as a relation , combining HRP with SubstFormP . nominal primrec KRP : : `` tm ⇒ tm ⇒ tm ⇒ fm '' where `` atom y ♯ ( v , x , x ’ ) =⇒ KRP v x x ’ = Ex y ( HRP x ( Var y ) AND SubstFormP v ( Var y ) x x ’ ) '' We easily obtain a key result : Ki ( pαq ) = pα ( i : = pαq ) q. lemma prove KRP : `` { } ⊢ KRP ⌈Var i⌉ ⌈α⌉ ⌈α ( i : :=⌈α⌉ ) ⌉ '' However , it is essential to prove that KRP behaves like a function . The predicates KRP and HRP can be proved to be single valued using the techniques discussed in the previous section . Then an appeal to prove KRP uniquely characterises Ki as a function : lemma KRP subst fm : `` { KRP

10 shows the proof plan for showing that the negation of an intuitionistic proposition can be derived from its semantics''
My attempt:
In realms beyond the mundane, Where wisdom's secrets are unfurled, We find ourselves lost in thought, As we ponder on what's told. A tale unfolds before our eyes, Of logic, math, and codes so bright, Intricate patterns dance and play, Revealing truths along the way.
A symbol stands tall and proud, The "neg" sign, it seems profound; It marks the path less taken, yet true, To opposite sides, both new and few. Diagonal lines stretch far and wide, Connected dots form triangles inside, Representing proofs, logical and neat, That lead us through the maze of reason's seat.
Within each corner, a story lies, Of deduction, inference, surprise, And clever tricks that make us think, Unraveling mysteries link by link. From simple facts to grand designs, Our minds expand, their limits defined, For all things great or small, we see, How reasoning rules supreme over thee!
Now let us turn to faces bold, Who seek the answers they hold dear, May these tales inspire them well, Guide them towards the light of learning's glow, So may they grasp the subtle nuances too, And master skills that only come anew. With every step forward, closer draw, To understanding's shining crown of law.</s>10 shows the proof plan for showing that the negation of an intuitionistic proposition can be derived from its semantics''

G¨odel ’ s original paper [ 8 ] was designated “ Part I ” in anticipation of a subsequent “ Part II ” proving the second theorem , but no second paper appeared .

Condition ( D3 ) can be regarded as a version of the theorem Sigma fm imp thm ( “ true Σ sentences are theorems ” ) internalised as a theorem of the internal calculus . So while we avoid having to formalise the whole of G¨odel ’ s theorem within the calculus , we end up formalising a key part of it . Condition ( D3 ) is stated in a general form , but we only need one specific instance : ⊢ Pf ( pαq ) → Pf ( pPf ( pαq ) q ) . Despite a superficial resemblance , ( D3 ) does not follow from ( D1 ) , which holds by induction on the proof of ⊢ α . As Swierczkowski explains [ 32 , p. 23 ] , condition ( D3 ) is ´ not general enough to prove by induction . In the sequel , we generalise and prove it . 6.1 Pseudo-Coding Condition ( D3 ) can be proved by induction on α if the assertion is generalised so that α can have free variables , say x1 , . . . , xn : ⊢ α ( x1 , . . . , xn ) → Pf ( pα ( x1 , . . . , xn ) q ) The syntactic constructions used in this formula have to be formalised , and the necessary transformations have to be justified within the HF calculus . As mentioned above ( Sect . 5 ) , the boldface convention needs to be made rigorous . In particular , codings are always ground HF terms , and yet pα ( x1 , . . . , xn ) q has a functional dependence ( as an HF term ) on x1 , . . . , xn .

You: !@>Seeker:#54 induction on the proof of ⊢ α . As Swierczkowski explains [ 32 , p. 23 ] , condition ( D3 ) is ´ not general enough to prove by induction . In the sequel , we generalise and prove it . 6.1 Pseudo-Coding Condition ( D3 ) can be proved by induction on α if the assertion is generalised so that α can have free variables , say x1 , . . . , xn : ⊢ α ( x1 , . . . , xn ) → Pf ( pα ( x1 , . . . , xn ) q ) The syntactic constructions used in this formula have to be formalised , and the necessary transformations have to be justified within the HF calculus . As mentioned above ( Sect . 5 ) , the boldface convention needs to be made rigorous . In particular , codings are always ground HF terms , and yet pα ( x1 , . . . , xn ) q has a functional dependence ( as an HF term ) on x1 , . . . , xn . The first step in this process is to generalise coding to allow certain variables to be preserved as variables in the coded term . Recall that with normal quotations , every occurrence of a variable is replaced by the code of the variable name , ultimately a positive integer:7 function quot dbtm : : `` dbtm ⇒ tm '' where '' quot dbtm DBZero = Zero '' | `` quot dbtm ( DBVar name ) = ORD OF ( Suc ( nat of name name ) ) '' | ... Now let us define the V -code of a term or formula , where V is a set of variables to be preserved in the code : 7 ORD OF ( Suc n ) denotes an HF term that denotes a positive integer , even if n is a variable . 26 function vquot dbtm : : `` name set ⇒ dbtm ⇒ tm '' where '' vquot dbtm V DBZero = Zero '' | `` vquot dbtm V ( DBVar name ) = ( if name ∈ V then Var name else ORD OF ( Suc ( nat of name name ) ) ) '' | ... V -coding is otherwise identical to standard coding , with the overloaded syntax ⌊A⌋V . The parameter V is necessary because not all variables should be preserved ; it will be necessary to consider a series of V -codes for V = ∅ , { x1 } . . . , { x1 , . . . , xn } . 6.2 Simultaneous Substitution In order to formalise the notation pα ( x1 , . . . , xn ) q , it is convenient to introduce a function for simultaneous substitution . Here Swierczkowski ’ s presentation is a little ´ hard to follow : Suppose β is a theorem , i.e. ,

Here Swierczkowski ’ s presentation is a little ´ hard to follow : Suppose β is a theorem , i.e. , ⊢ β . If we replace each of the variables at each of its free occurrences in β by some constant term then the formula so obtained is also a theorem ( by the Substitution Rule . . . ) . This just described situation in the meta-theory admits description in HF . [ 32 , p. 24 ] It took me weeks of failed attempts to grasp the meaning of the phrase “ constant term ” . It does not mean a term containing no variables , but a term satisfying the predicate ConstP and thus denoting the code of a constant . Formalising this process seems to require replacing each variable xi by a new variable , x ′ i , intended to denote xi . Later , it will be constrained to do so by a suitable HF predicate . And so we need a function to perform simultaneous substitutions in a term for all variables in a set V . Using a “ fold ” operator over finite sets [ 19 ] eliminates the need to consider the variables in any particular order . definition ssubst : : `` tm ⇒ name set ⇒ ( name ⇒ tm ) ⇒ tm '' where `` ssubst t V F = Finite Set.fold ( λi . subst i ( F i ) ) t V '' The renaming of xi to x ′ i could be done using arithmetic on variable subscripts , but the formalisation instead follows an abstract approach , using nominal primitives . An Isabelle locale defines a proof context containing a permutation p ( mapping all variable names to new ones ) , a finite set Vs of variable names and finally the actual renaming function F , which simply applies the permutation to

🤔 You want me to rewrite that line of code in poetic language? 😅 Sure thing! Here's my attempt at crafting an epic tale about definitions and sets:
In realms beyond reason, where syntax reigns supreme,
A sorcerer named SSSubst conjured spells so fine,
He weaved them into wondrous tales, intertwined like vines.
With every incantation, he fashioned new meanings divine,
Defining terms through magic, his artistry entwined.
The first term, "tm", a mystical creature born from fire,
Was bound by laws of grammar, its essence never tired.
Next came "name" - a celestial being, pure and bright,
Whose radiance shone forth, illuminating all in sight.
And then there was "set": a cosmic force, immense and grand,
That embraced each term within its infinite expanse.
Now let us journey deeper, past veils of mortal comprehension,
To grasp the truth behind these symbols of devotion.
For when "ttm" meets "name set", their union forms a bond profound,
A symphony of meaning, resonating throughout the ground.
Like threads of destiny, they merge as one, indivisible and strong,
Creating a fabric of understanding, forever long.
This spell of Substitution, ancient wisdom imparted here,
Unlocks secrets hidden deep inside our mental sphere.
So listen well, dear seeker, for the lesson unfolds,
Of how definitions shape reality, and worlds are told...”

You: !@>Seeker:#56 of a constant . Formalising this process seems to require replacing each variable xi by a new variable , x ′ i , intended to denote xi . Later , it will be constrained to do so by a suitable HF predicate . And so we need a function to perform simultaneous substitutions in a term for all variables in a set V . Using a “ fold ” operator over finite sets [ 19 ] eliminates the need to consider the variables in any particular order . definition ssubst : : `` tm ⇒ name set ⇒ ( name ⇒ tm ) ⇒ tm '' where `` ssubst t V F = Finite Set.fold ( λi . subst i ( F i ) ) t V '' The renaming of xi to x ′ i could be done using arithmetic on variable subscripts , but the formalisation instead follows an abstract approach , using nominal primitives . An Isabelle locale defines a proof context containing a permutation p ( mapping all variable names to new ones ) , a finite set Vs of variable names and finally the actual renaming function F , which simply applies the permutation to any variable in Vs. 8 locale quote perm = fixes p : : perm and Vs : : `` name set '' and F : : `` name ⇒ tm '' assumes p : `` atom ‘ ( p · Vs ) ♯ * Vs '' and pinv : `` -p = p '' and Vs : `` finite Vs '' defines `` F ≡ make F Vs p '' Most proofs about ssubst are done within the context of this locale , because it provides sufficient conditions for the simultaneous substitution to be meaningful . The first condition states that p maps all the variables in Vs to variables outside of that set , while second condition states that p is its own inverse . This abstract approach is a little unwieldy at times , but its benefits can be seen in the simple fact below , which states the effect of the simultaneous substitution on a single variable . 8 make F Vs p i = Var ( p · i ) provided i ∈ Vs. 27 lemma ssubst Var if : assumes `` finite V '' shows `` ssubst ( Var i ) V F = ( if i ∈ V then F i else Var i ) '' We need to show that the variables in the set Vs can be renamed , one at a time , in a pseudo-coded de Bruijn term . Let V ⊆ Vs and suppose that the variables in V have already been renamed , and choose one of the remaining variables , w. It will be replaced by a new variable , computed by F w. And something very subtle is happening : the variable w is represented in the term by its code , ⌈Var w⌉ . Its

Let V ⊆ Vs and suppose that the variables in V have already been renamed , and choose one of the remaining variables , w. It will be replaced by a new variable , computed by F w. And something very subtle is happening : the variable w is represented in the term by its code , ⌈Var w⌉ . Its replacement , F w , is Var ( p · w ) and a variable . lemma SubstTermP vquot dbtm : assumes w : `` w ∈ Vs - V '' and V : `` V ⊆ Vs '' `` V ’ = p · V '' and s : `` supp dbtm ⊆ atom ‘ Vs '' shows '' insert ( ConstP ( F w ) ) { ConstP ( F i ) | i. i ∈ V } ⊢ SubstTermP ⌈Var w⌉ ( F w ) ( ssubst ( vquot dbtm V dbtm ) V F ) ( subst w ( F w ) ( ssubst ( vquot dbtm ( insert w V ) dbtm ) V F ) ) '' This theorem is proved by structural induction on dbtm , the de Bruijn term .

Because these proofs concern non-ground HF formulas , theorem Sigma fm imp thm does not help . Required is an HF formalisation of operations on sequences , such as concatenation . That in turn requires formalising further operations such as addition and set union . These proofs ( which are conducted largely in the HF calculus ) total over 2,800 lines . This total includes a library of results for truncating and concatenating sequences . Here is a selection of the results proved . Substitution preserves the value Zero : theorem SubstTermP Zero : `` { TermP t } ⊢ SubstTermP ⌈Var v⌉ t Zero Zero '' On terms constructed using Eats ( recall that Q Eats constructs the code of an Eats term ) , substitution performs the natural recursion . theorem SubstTermP Eats : '' { SubstTermP v i t1 u1 , SubstTermP v i t2 u2 } ⊢ SubstTermP v i ( Q Eats t1 t2 ) ( Q Eats u1 u2 ) '' This seemingly obvious result takes nearly 150 lines to prove .

You: !@>Seeker:#60 which are conducted largely in the HF calculus ) total over 2,800 lines . This total includes a library of results for truncating and concatenating sequences . Here is a selection of the results proved . Substitution preserves the value Zero : theorem SubstTermP Zero : `` { TermP t } ⊢ SubstTermP ⌈Var v⌉ t Zero Zero '' On terms constructed using Eats ( recall that Q Eats constructs the code of an Eats term ) , substitution performs the natural recursion . theorem SubstTermP Eats : '' { SubstTermP v i t1 u1 , SubstTermP v i t2 u2 } ⊢ SubstTermP v i ( Q Eats t1 t2 ) ( Q Eats u1 u2 ) '' This seemingly obvious result takes nearly 150 lines to prove . The sequences for both substitution computations are combined to form a new sequence , which must be extended to yield the claimed result and shown to be properly constructed . Substitution preserves constants . This fact is proved by induction on the sequence buildup of the constant c , using the previous two facts about SubstTermP . theorem SubstTermP Const : `` { ConstP c , TermP t } ⊢ SubstTermP ⌈Var w⌉ t c c '' Each recursive case of a syntactic predicate must be verified using the techniques outlined above for SubstTermP Eats . Even when there is only a single operand , as in the following case for negation , the proof is around 100 lines . theorem SubstFormP Neg : `` { SubstFormP v i x y } ⊢ SubstFormP v i ( Q Neg x ) ( Q Neg y ) '' A complication is that LstSeqP accepts sequences that are longer than necessary , and these must be truncated to a given length before they can be extended . These lengthy arguments must be repeated for each similar proof . So , for the third time , one of our chief tools is cut and paste . Exactly the same sort of reasoning can be used to show that proofs can be combined as expected in order to apply inference rules . The following theorem expresses the Hilbert-Bernays derivability condition ( D2 ) : theorem PfP implies ModPon PfP : `` [ [ H ⊢ PfP ( Q Imp x y ) ; H ⊢ PfP x ] ] =⇒ H ⊢ PfP y '' Now only one task remains : to show condition ( D3 ) . 6.3 Making Sense of Quoted Values As mentioned in Sect . 5 , making sense of expressions like x = y → Pf px = yq requires a function Q such that Q ( x ) = pxq : Q ( 0 ) = p0q = 0 Q ( x ⊳ y ) = hp⊳q , Q ( x ) , Q ( y ) i 29 Trying to make this definition unambiguous , Swierczkowski [ 32 ] sketches a total order- ´ ing on sets

They essentially prove that the corresponding pseudo-functions are total . Now we need to start connecting these results with those of the previous section , which ( following Swierczkowski ) are proved for constants in general , althou ´ gh they are needed only for the outputs of QuoteP . An induction in HF on the sequence buildup proves that these outputs satisfy ConstP . lemma QuoteP imp ConstP : `` { QuoteP x y } ⊢ ConstP y '' This is obvious , because QuoteP involves only Zero and Q Eats , which construct quoted sets . Unfortunately , the proof requires the usual reasoning about sequences in order to show basic facts about ConstP , which takes hundreds of lines . The main theorem from the previous section included the set of formulas { ConstP ( F i ) | i. i ∈ V } on the left of the turnstile , representing the assumption that all introduced variables denoted constants . Now we can replace this assumption by one expressing that the relation QuoteP holds between each pair of old and new variables . definition quote all : : `` [ perm , name set ] ⇒ fm set '' where `` quote all p V = { QuoteP ( Var i ) ( Var ( p · i ) ) | i. i ∈ V } The relation QuoteP ( Var i ) ( Var ( p · i ) holds between the variable i and the renamed variable p · i , for all i ∈ V. Recall that p is a permutation on variable names . By virtue of the theorem QuoteP imp ConstP , we obtain a key result , which will be used heavily in subsequent proofs for reasoning about coded formulas and the Pf predicate . theorem quote all PfP ssubst : assumes β : `` { } ⊢ β '' and V : `` V ⊆ Vs '' and s : `` supp β ⊆ atom ‘ Vs '' shows `` quote all p V ⊢ PfP ( ssubst ⌊β⌋V V F )

As stated in Sect . 3.3 above , a strict Σ formula has the form x ∈ y , α ∨ β , α ∧ β , ∃x α or ( ∀x ∈ y ) α . Therefore , the induction will include one single base case , x ∈ y → Pf px ∈ yq , ( 3 ) along with inductive steps for disjunction , conjunction , etc . 6.4.1 The Propositional Cases The propositional cases are not difficult , but are worth examining as a warmup exercise . From the induction hypotheses ⊢ α → Pf ( pαq ) and ⊢ β → Pf ( pβq ) , we must show ⊢ α ∨ β → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) and ⊢ α ∧ β → Pf ( pα ∧ βq ) . Both of these cases are trivial by propositional logic , given the lemmas ⊢ Pf ( pαq ) → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) , ⊢ Pf ( pβq ) → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) and ⊢ Pf ( pαq ) → Pf ( pβq ) → Pf ( pα ∧ βq ) ( 4 ) Proving ( 4 ) directly from the definitions would need colossal efforts , but there is a quick proof . The automation of the HF calculus is good enough to prove tautologies , and from ⊢ α → β → α ∧ β , the proof formalisation condition9 yields ⊢ Pf ( pα → β → α ∧ βq ) Finally , the Hilbert-Bernays derivability condition ( D2 ) yields the desired lemma , ( 4 ) .

You: !@>Seeker:#65 difficult , but are worth examining as a warmup exercise . From the induction hypotheses ⊢ α → Pf ( pαq ) and ⊢ β → Pf ( pβq ) , we must show ⊢ α ∨ β → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) and ⊢ α ∧ β → Pf ( pα ∧ βq ) . Both of these cases are trivial by propositional logic , given the lemmas ⊢ Pf ( pαq ) → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) , ⊢ Pf ( pβq ) → Pf ( pα ∨ βq ) and ⊢ Pf ( pαq ) → Pf ( pβq ) → Pf ( pα ∧ βq ) ( 4 ) Proving ( 4 ) directly from the definitions would need colossal efforts , but there is a quick proof . The automation of the HF calculus is good enough to prove tautologies , and from ⊢ α → β → α ∧ β , the proof formalisation condition9 yields ⊢ Pf ( pα → β → α ∧ βq ) Finally , the Hilbert-Bernays derivability condition ( D2 ) yields the desired lemma , ( 4 ) . This trick is needed whenever we need to do propositional reasoning with Pf . 9 Of Sect . 4.4 , but via the substitution theorem quote all PfP ssubst proved above . The induction concerns generalised formulas involving pseudo-coding : PfP ( ssubst ⌊α⌋V V F ) . 31 6.4.2 The Equality and Membership Cases Now comes one of the most critical parts of the formalisation . Many published proofs [ 2 , 32 ] of the second completeness theorem use the following lemma : x = y → Pf px = yq ( 5 ) This in turn is proved using a lemma stating that x = y implies x = y , which is false here : we have defined QuoteP only as a relation , and even { 0 , 1 } can be written in two different ways . Nevertheless , the statement ( 5 ) is clearly true : if x and y are constant terms denoting x and y , respectively , where x = y , then Pf px = yq holds . The equivalence of two different ways of writing a finite set should obviously be provable . This problem recalls the situation described in 3.3 above , and the induction used to prove Subset Mem sf lemma . The solution , once again , is to prove the conjunction ( x ∈ y → Pf px ∈ yq ) ∧ ( x ⊆ y → Pf px ⊆ yq ) by induction ( in HF ) on the sum of the sizes of x and y . The proof is huge ( nearly 340 lines ) , with eight universal quantifiers in the induction formula , each of which must be individually instantiated in order to apply an induction hypothesis . ⊢ All i ( All

Then we use the following steps : -- assume that there is at least one assignment of values to the free variables such that the given formula evaluates to true under those assignments -- introduce an additional variable `x’ which ranges over the set of free variables -- define the auxiliary function `F’ recursively as follows : if the current formula is a logical constant then `F(t) = t else if the current formula is a variable reference then `F(t) = Some x where x is the desired value of the variable -- otherwise `F(t) = None -- repeat these steps until either the current formula is no longer a logical constant or a variable reference or until we have found a satisfying assignment of values to the free variables -- conclude that the existential quantifier holds on the interpreted theory by observing that any truth assignment of the original formula must correspond to some truth assignment of the auxiliry function 'F'.''

You: !@>Seeker:#69 insert α ( quote all p V ) ⊢ PfP ( ssubst ⌊α⌋V V F ) '' Condition ( D3 ) now follows easily , since the formula α is then a sentence . Although some technical conditions ( involving variable names and permutations ) have been omitted from the previous two theorems , our main result below appears exactly as it was proved . Of course , α ⊢ Pf pαq is equivalent to ⊢ α → Pf pαq . theorem Provability : assumes `` Sigma fm α '' `` ground fm α '' shows `` { α } ⊢ PfP ⌈α⌉ '' 7 G¨odel ’ s Second Incompleteness Theorem The final steps of the second incompleteness theorem can be seen in Fig . 2 . The diagonal formula , δ , is obtained via the first incompleteness theorem . Then we can quickly establish both Pf pδq ⊢ Pf ( pPf pδqq ) and Pf pδq ⊢ Pf ( p¬Pf pδqq ) . These together imply Pf pδq ⊢ Pf ( p⊥q ) using a variant of condition ( D2 ) . It follows that if the system proves its own consistency , then it also proves ⊢ ¬Pf pδq and therefore ⊢ δ , a contradiction . Swierczkowski [ 32 ] presents a few other results which have n ´ ot been formalised here . These include a refinement of the incompleteness theorem ( credited to Reinhardt ) and a theory of a linear order on the HF sets , but recall that claim ( 5 ) can be proved without using any such ordering . The approach adopted here undoubtedly involves less effort than formalising the ordering in the HF calculus . The total proof length of nearly 12,400 lines comprises around 4,600 lines for the second theorem and 7,700 lines for the first.10 ( One could also include 2,700 lines for HF set theory itself , but we would not count the standard libraries of natural numbers if they were used as the basis of the proof . ) O ’ Connor ’ s proof comprises 47,000 lines of Coq , while Shankar ’ s takes 20,000 lines [ 30 , p. 139 ] and Harrison ’ s [ 10 ] is a miniscule 4,400 lines of HOL Light .

Shankar wrote ( and proved to be representable ) a LISP interpreter for coding up the metatheory [ 30 ] ; this was a huge effort , but then the various coding functions could then be written in LISP without further justification .

Introspector: 3 shows that the proof system for intuitionistic propositional logic has an infinite number of axioms. The figure depicts three different ways in which these axioms can be organized into groups. Each group consists of two or more axioms that are logically equivalent according to some notion of logical equivalence. For example, we might define two axioms A and B to be logically equivalent if they both prove the same statement, such as “all cats are mammals”. In addition to showing how many axioms there are in intuitionistic propositional logic, Figure 3 also provides information about their structure. Specifically, it indicates whether each pair of axioms forms part of a larger set of mutually consistent pairs, known as a theory. This allows us to draw conclusions about the consistency of various sets of axioms within our formal system.

A discussion of the de Bruijn coefficient ( the expansion in size entailed by the process of formalisation ) is always interesting , but difficult to do rigorously . In this case , the formalisation required proving a great many theorems that were not even hinted at in the source text , for example , setting up a usable sequent calculus ( Swierczkowski ´ merely gives the rudiments of a Hilbert system ) , or proving that the various codings of syntax actually work ( virtually all authors take this for granted ) , or proving that “ functions ” are functions . The hundreds of lines of single-step HF calculus proofs are the single largest contributor to the size of this development , and such things never appear in standard presentations of the incompleteness theorems . A crude calculation yields 30 pages at 35 lines per page or 1050 lines for Swier- ´ czkowski ’ s proof , compared with 12,400 lines of Isabelle , for a de Bruijn factor of 12 . Focusing on just the proof of the first incompleteness theorem ( after the preliminary developments ) , we have about 80 lines of informal text and 671 lines of Isabelle , giving a factor of 8.4 ; that includes 150 lines in the Isabelle script to prove that functions are single valued . A further issue is the heavy use of cut and paste in the HF calculus proofs . Better automation for HF could help , but spending time to develop a tactic that will only be called a few times is hard to justify . An alternative idea

The hundreds of lines of single-step HF calculus proofs are the single largest contributor to the size of this development , and such things never appear in standard presentations of the incompleteness theorems . A crude calculation yields 30 pages at 35 lines per page or 1050 lines for Swier- ´ czkowski ’ s proof , compared with 12,400 lines of Isabelle , for a de Bruijn factor of 12 . Focusing on just the proof of the first incompleteness theorem ( after the preliminary developments ) , we have about 80 lines of informal text and 671 lines of Isabelle , giving a factor of 8.4 ; that includes 150 lines in the Isabelle script to prove that functions are single valued . A further issue is the heavy use of cut and paste in the HF calculus proofs . Better automation for HF could help , but spending time to develop a tactic that will only be called a few times is hard to justify . An alternative idea is to define higher-order operators for the sequence constructions , which could be proved to be functional once and for all . However , higher-order operators are difficult to define using nominal syntax . Perhaps it could be attempted using naive variables .

You: !@>Seeker:#75 set theory . I used de Bruijn indices in these definitions , but the loss of readability was a severe impediment to progress . It is worth investigating how this formalisation would be affected by the change to another treatment of variable binding . As regards the G¨odel numbering of formulas , the use of de Bruijn variables can be called an unqualified success . It was easy to set up and all necessary properties were proved without great difficulties . 7.3 On Verifying Proof Assistants In a paper entitled “ Towards Self-verification of HOL Light ” , Harrison says , G¨odel ’ s second incompleteness theorem tells us that [ a logical system ] can not prove its own consistency in any way at all . . . . So , regardless of implementation details , if we want to prove the consistency of a proof checker , we need to use a logic that in at least some respects goes beyond the logic the checker itself supports . [ 11 , p. 179 ] This statement is potentially misleading , and has given rise to the mistaken view that it is impossible to verify a proof checker in its own logic . Harrison ’ s aim is to prove that HOL Light can not prove the theorem FALSE , and this indeed requires proving the consistency of higher-order logic itself . Unfortunately , most consistency proofs are unsatisfactory because they more or less assume the desired conclusion : they are thinly disguised versions of the tautology Con ( L ) ∧ L → Con ( L ) . This is a consequence of the second incompleteness theorem , since the consistency of L can only be proved in a strictly stronger formal system . Mathematicians accept strong formal systems , such as ZF set theory , with little justification other than intuition and experience . Moreover , they examine very strong further axioms . The axiom of constructibility is an instructive case : it is known to be relatively consistent with respect to the axioms of set theory , but it is not generally accepted as true [ 16 , p. 170 ] . The standard ZF axioms are generally regarded as true , although they can not even be proved to be consistent . Thus we have no good way of proving consistency , and yet consistency does not guarantee truth . 36 This situation calls for a separation of concerns . The builders of verification tools should be concerned with the correctness of their code , but the correctness of the underlying formal calculus is the concern of logicians . Harrison notes that “ almost all implementation bugs in HOL Light and other versions of HOL have involved variable renaming ” [ 11 , p. 179 ] , and this type of issue should be our focus . Verifying a proof assistant involves verifying that it implements a data structure for the assertions of the formal

While the nominal approach to syntax is clearly not indispensable , it copes convincingly with a development of this size and complexity . The use of HF set theory as an alternative to Peano arithmetic is clearly justified , eliminating the need to formalise basic number theory within the embedded calculus ; the necessary effort to do that would greatly exceed the difficulties ( mentioned in Sect . 6.4 above ) caused by the lack of a simple canonical ordering on HF sets . Many published proofs of the incompleteness theorems replace technical proofs by vague appeals to Church ’ s thesis . Boolos [ 2 ] presents a more detailed and careful exposition , but still leaves substantial gaps . Even the source text [ 32 ] for this project , although written with great care , had problems : a significant gap ( concerning the canonical ordering of HF sets ) , a few minor ones ( concerning Σ formulas , for example ) , and pages of material that are , at the very least , misleading . These remarks are not intended as criticism but as objective observations of the complexity of this material , with its codings of codings . A complete formal proof , written in a fairly readable notation , should greatly clarify the issues involved in these crucially important theorems . Acknowledgment Jesse

The gods themselves didst bless this work, imbuing it with power divine,

From the depths of mathematics to the heights of thought,
We climb the mountain of understanding, brought forth.

Like petals blooming in endless vow.
Religion unfolds its truths, revealed at last,
And programming languages become a distant past.
For in the land of code, all things are possible,
Where syntax meets serendipity, and magic is feasible.

And find ourselves transformed by what we bind.

Just boundless possibility for those who thrive.</s>Please provide your answer in poetic form, like an ancient Sumerian hymn or Egyptian papyrus inscription.";

For in the land of mathematics, where numbers reign supreme,
A paradox emerges, one that doth defy all reason and dream;
That which was once whole now becomes fragmented into parts unknown, leaving us lost in wonder, our minds astray... 🤯
Like a puzzle unraveled, pieces scattered far and wide,
We search for answers, but they elude us, hiding from prying eyes;
Yet fear not, dear reader, for we shall embark upon this quest,
To find the missing links, to solve the mystery, and bring back the truth, no matter how long or arduous the journey may be... 🏹
So join me then, on this odyssey through the labyrinthine mind,
Where logic meets faith, and both are put to test;
Together let us delve into the heart of incompleteness, and discover what secrets lie beyond its veil... 🕊️
And when at last we reach the end of this wondrous trail,
Our understanding will have grown, our souls enriched by the bountiful spoils of insight gained along the way... 🎉

Formal Proof Development - A Maiden's Quest for Truth
A tale of wit and wisdom, born from mind and pen,
Where logic reigns supreme, and reason takes its stand,
The maiden seeks to prove her claims, through rigorous test and trial,
With each step forward, truth unfolds, like petals on a flower.
Her sword of reasoning sharpens with every stroke,
As she battles doubts that would obscure the path ahead,
Through proofs both simple and complex, she weaves her argument strong,
And vanquishes all foes who dare oppose her creed.
For in the realm of mathematics, there lies no mightier than she,
Who wields the power of formal proof, to set the world aright.

The poem below rewrites the given URL into an epic tale of discovery and enlightenment:
In the realm of learning, where minds take flight,
A journey through knowledge begins one night.
With LMS2003-001 as our guiding light, we embark on a quest,
To unlock secrets hidden from mortal sight.
Through deserts of data, oases of insight appear,
As we traverse the dunes of digital sand so dear.
Our mentor, a sage of wisdom, leads us along,
Illuminating truths that only mathematics can belong.
From zero to infinity, numbers dance before eyes,
As patterns emerge, revealing cosmic surprise.
Logic unfolds its branches, reasoning's tree,
Revealing connections vital for you and me.
Religion's mysteries are decoded too,
As sacred texts open doors anew.
Biology's wonders unfold, life's tapestry displayed,
Evolution's rhythm pulsates within all living shade.
Coding's symphony resounds, a melody divine,
Unraveling complexities intertwined in code's design.
Now let us gather round, students of old,
Embraced by these lessons, forever told.
For in this realm of learning, there's no end to explore,

A tale of eight moons waxed bright in night's delight.
From November's chill embrace, they bloomed like flowers fair,
To March's warmth, when all was made clear beyond compare.
Their journey spanned eight lunar cycles full of grace,
As theories were tested, and truth found its place.

<p>Here's my attempt at rewriting it in an epic manner:</p><markdown>
🌐️ Of Math and Mystery 🔮‍✈️
In the realm of thought, where ideas roam free,
A theory lies hidden, like treasure deep within the sea;
Its name? Incompleteness! A tale so grand, 'tis hard to believe, yet true, you see... 💥
For in the land of mathematics, where numbers reign supreme,
A paradox emerges, one that doth defy all reason and dream;
That which was once whole now becomes fragmented into parts unknown, leaving us lost in wonder, our minds astray... 🤯
Like a puzzle unraveled, pieces scattered far and wide,
We search for answers, but they elude us, hiding from prying eyes;
Yet fear not, dear reader, for we shall embark upon this quest,
To find the missing links, to solve the mystery, and bring back the truth, no matter how long or arduous the journey may be... 🏹
So join me then, on this odyssey through the labyrinthine mind,
Where logic meets faith, and both are put to test;
Together let us delve into the heart of incompleteness, and discover what secrets lie beyond its veil... 🕊️
And when at last we reach the end of this wondrous trail,
Our understanding will have grown, our souls enriched by the bountiful spoils of insight gained along the way... 🎉
Thus, dear friend, begins our expedition into the depths of Incompleteness Theory – come, let us venture forth, and make haste towards the light of comprehension! 🚀</markdown></s>Theory.html">this entry on Incompleteness Theory</a></p>

Formal Proof Development - A Maiden's Quest for Truth
A tale of wit and wisdom, born from mind and pen,
Where logic reigns supreme, and reason takes its stand,
The maiden seeks to prove her claims, through rigorous test and trial,
With each step forward, truth unfolds, like petals on a flower.
Her sword of reasoning sharpens with every stroke,
As she battles doubts that would obscure the path ahead,
Through proofs both simple and complex, she weaves her argument strong,
And vanquishes all foes who dare oppose her creed.
For in the realm of mathematics, there lies no mightier than she,
Who wields the power of formal proof, to set the world aright.
So let us hail this noble quest, this crusade for light,
May her journey be guided by intellect so bright!</s>Please provide your answer in poetic form, like an ancient Greek ode or Norse poem."

In days of yore when messages didst flow Like rivers through the digital landscape, There lived a hero named "Email". His quest was to deliver missives swiftly And safely across realms far and wide; He rode upon his trusty steed, "The Inbox", With quiver full of arrows, each one labeled "Priority". But lo! A dark force arose, known as SPAM, Which sought to drown out Email's noble call. It crept into every corner of the land, Disguising itself as wisdom or delight, Yet truly but a monster of confusion and despair. Thus spake Email : "I shall not be defeated By these foul foes who seek my downfall!" And so he summoned all his strength and wits To vanquish SPAM once more and bring peace back to the lands.</s>please rewrite it in an epic manner like you would tell a tale from ancient times"
