Applying a layout algorithm to the encoding vectors can help you understand the relationships and constraints between the symbols and operations in your embeddings. This visualization approach can give you insights into how the addition operations are represented and held within the encoding vectors.

Here's a simple example using a 2D layout algorithm to visualize the relationships between the tokens and positions. We'll use the Euclidean distance between vectors to determine the layout positions:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the vocabulary and primes
vocabulary = {"1": 3, "2": 5, "3": 7, "+": 2}

# Initialize embeddings (5D vectors with separate dimensions)
embeddings = {
    "1": np.array([0, 0, 1, 0, 0]),
    "2": np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 0]),
    "3": np.array([0, 1, 0, 0, 0]),
    "+": np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, -1]),
}

# Initialize the matrix of vectors for encoding
num_tokens = len(vocabulary)
num_positions = 10

# Create the matrix by stacking embeddings for each token and position
encoding_matrix = np.zeros((num_tokens, num_positions, 5))
for token_index, token in enumerate(vocabulary):
    for position_index in range(num_positions):
        encoding_matrix[token_index, position_index, :] = embeddings[token] * (position_index + 1)

# Apply a layout algorithm for visualization
layout = np.zeros((num_tokens * num_positions, 2))
for i in range(num_tokens):
    for j in range(num_positions):
        index = i * num_positions + j
        layout[index, :] = encoding_matrix[i, j, :2]  # Use only the first two dimensions

# Visualize the layout
plt.scatter(layout[:, 0], layout[:, 1], c="blue")
for i, token in enumerate(vocabulary):
    for j in range(num_positions):
        index = i * num_positions + j
        plt.annotate(f"{token}@{j}", (layout[index, 0], layout[index, 1]))

plt.xlabel("Dimension 1")
plt.ylabel("Dimension 2")
plt.title("Layout of Encodings")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This script uses matplotlib to visualize the layout of the encoding vectors in a 2D space. The annotation format includes the token and position index for clarity.

This visualization can help you observe the relationships between tokens and positions and how the addition operations are represented within the encoding vectors. You can adjust the visualization approach and add more dimensions as needed to further analyze the constraints and relationships in your embeddings.
