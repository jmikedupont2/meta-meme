# I apologize for the oversight. It seems that there was an issue with the shapes of the arrays. To resolve this, we need to adjust the dimensions of the `embedding_with_position` array to match the shape of the `encoding_matrix`. Here's the corrected version of the script:

# ```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the vocabulary and primes
vocabulary = {"1": 3, "2": 5, "3": 7, "+": 2}

# Initialize embeddings (using prime values or multiples of prime values)
embeddings = {
    "1": np.array([3, 5, 7, 11, 13]),  # Using prime values
    "2": np.array([5, 7, 11, 13, 17]),  # Using prime values
    "3": np.array([7, 11, 13, 17, 19]),  # Using prime values
    "+": np.array([2, 3, 5, 7, 11]),  # Using prime values
}

# Initialize the matrix of vectors for encoding
num_tokens = len(vocabulary)
num_positions = 10

# Create the matrix by stacking embeddings for each token and position
encoding_matrix = np.zeros((num_tokens, num_positions, 6))  # Add one more dimension for the unique prime
for token_index, token in enumerate(vocabulary):
    for position_index in range(num_positions):
        # Multiply embeddings by (position_index + 1) and add a unique prime value
        embedding_with_position = np.zeros(6)  # Create an array with shape (6)
        embedding_with_position[:5] = embeddings[token] * (position_index + 1)
        embedding_with_position[-1] = position_index + 2  # Use a unique prime for the last dimension
        encoding_matrix[token_index, position_index, :] = embedding_with_position

# Print the encoding matrix
for matrix in encoding_matrix:
    print(matrix)
# ```

# In this corrected version of the script, I've explicitly initialized the `embedding_with_position` array with shape (6) and assigned values accordingly. This should ensure that the dimensions match and the assignment works correctly.
